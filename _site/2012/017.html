<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
 Clean drinking water is a matter of concern for all countries, more so for many developing countries and consequently various methods of producing clean drinking water are being practiced for provision of such water to the consumers. At the same time an attempt is always made to adopt any new technique or technology to use it for commercially feasible production of such water. In recent years, with the advent of fast developing technologies, nanotechnology has also come into operation for economic and commercial production of clean drinking water. With a view to produce clean drinking water free from pathogens by the use of nanotechnology, we have investigated the antibacterial properties of silver (Ag) nanoparticles against waterborne bacteria in the public water supply sources in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. Water samples from over 50 water supply sources were collected and bacterial strains were identified by API20E method. Different silver nanoparticles were tested against 8 different bacterial isolates at concentrations varying from 26 to about 77 µg/mL. Nanoparticles of size ranging from 3-8 nm prepared by casein stabilization method showed the best activity against all isolated strains, E. coli being the most effectively inhibited with an average 14.9 mm zone of inhibition. C. sakazakii (12.6 mm) was most sensitive to citrate stabilized particles, followed by E. coli (12.3 mm), K. pneumoniae (12 mm) and P. aeruginosa (11.6 mm). These results provide a useful picture for the development of water filters incorporated with silver nanoparticles. We believe that this study is important for the public, particularly in the developing countries and also for others working in the area of antibacterial effects of nanoparticles.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Among the many different types of metallic

and metal oxide nanoparticle (NPs), Silver (Ag) NPs have proven to be the most

effective against bacteria, viruses, and other eukaryotic microorganisms (Liu

et al., 2009; Chamundeeswari et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2009; Sharma et al.,

2008). Antibacterial activity of Ag is very well known from history. Ag NPs

attack the respiratory chain and cell division that &#64257;nally lead to cell

death, while concomitantly releasing silver ions that enhance bactericidal

activity (Klasen 2000).</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Several investigators have assessed

the biocidal efficacy of silver nanoparticles. (Baker et al., 2005; Panacek et al.,

2006; Kim et al., 2007; Shrivastava et al.,

2007; Li et al., 2010)Silver significantly reduces waterborne pathogens like <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pseudomonas aeruginosa

</i>and Aeromonas</i><i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> hydrophila</i> by

inactivating them. It can also be used as a secondary disinfectant (Silvestry-Rodriguez et al.,

2007). Kim et al. (2007) reported the effect of silver nanoparticles against yeast,

Escherichia coli</i>, and <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.

They reported that Ag nanoparticles can be used as effective growth inhibitors

against various microorganisms, which makes it capable of being applied in

diverse medical devices and systems for antimicrobial control. Elechiguerra et al.

</i>(2005) studied the size dependent effect of silver nanoparticles on HIV-1 virus. They reported

that silver nano particles inhibit the binding

of virus to the host cells in vitro. Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (2004), studied the antibacterial effect of

silver nano particles against <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were used to study

the biocidal action of this nano

scale material. Their results confirmed that the treated <i>Escherichia coli</i>

cells were damaged, showing formation of "pits" in the cell wall of the

bacteria. They reported that these nontoxic nano

materials, which can be prepared in a simple and cost-effective manner, may be

suitable for the formulation of new types of bactericidal materials. In another

study, the bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles obtained by a novel

electrochemical method on <i>Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium

phoeniceum</i> cultures were studied. The silver nanoparticles show a pronounced

antibacterial/antifungal effect (Khaydarov et al., 2009). Parameswari

et al. </i>(2010) compared the

antimicrobial activity of silver nano particles and

AgNO<sub>3 </sub>against <i>E. coli</i> in

terms of growth rate, time dependency and zone of inhibition. Ag nano particles created a zone of inhibition of 1.7 cm as

compared to 0.8 cm by AgNO<sub>3</sub>, thus proving Ag nanoparticles to be the

efficient candidate for antimicrobial activity. Similarly,

another study by Morones et al. (2005) on

bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles against gram negative bacteria

showed that the effect is size dependent and the most effective range of

nanoparticle sizes that provided direct interaction with the bacteria had a

diameter of ~1–10&nbsp;nm amongst the tested range of 1-100 nm.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Silver nanoparticles are highly active and show better

biocidal results against Gram negative bacteria such

as <i>E. coli</i> (Tiwari

and Behari, 2009) as compared to Gram positive bacteria and the effects are dose

dependent  (Madigan and Martinko, 2005). The antimicrobial activity of Ag NPs is

inversely dependent on size (Raimond et al., 2005; Sondi and Salopek-Sondi, 2004). Pal et al. (2007) reported that antibacterial activity of

silver nanoparticles is also dependent upon the shape of the nanoparticles.

There is another report showing the use of fullerenes

and carbon nanotubes as antimicrobial agents (Kang et al., 2007; Badireddy et al., 2007). In this study, antibacterial

activity of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was tested against different Gram

positive and Gram negative waterborne bacterial strains which were isolated and

identified from water samples taken from different water supply sources of

Islamabad working under Capital Development Authority (CDA). </p>


<h2>2.   Material and Methods</h2>
<h4>2.1. Synthesis of Ag Nanoparticle</h4>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Ag nanoparticles of

three particles sizes (S1= 3-8nm, S2= 4-8nm and S3 = 5-9 nm) were prepared for

the present investigation by following methods.</p>

<h4>2.1.1. Synthesis of Casein (protein) Stabilized Sliver Nanoparticles (S1)</h4>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In a typical experiment

to synthesize casein (protein) stabilized silver nanoparticles, a given volume

of a warm aqueous suspension of casein, set at a desired pH (7-8), was added

quickly to a boiling aqueous solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub> (25 mL, 1 mM) under vigorous stirring. The color

of the reaction mixture gradually changed from colorless

to brown within 5 – 10 minutes. The reflux was continued for one hour to ensure

complete reaction resulting in the formation of a brownish silver nanoparticles

suspension. The nanoparticle suspension was then filter purified using

centrifuge filters (Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filters

by Millipore Corporation) having a molecular cut off value of 100kDa to remove

excess casein and other impurities and then stored at room temperature for

further analysis and use in subsequent experiments. Casein (molecular weight

75–100 kDa) used in this work was of Hammerstein

grade purchased from MP Biomedicals. All solutions of

casein were prepared in 50 mM Tris

buffer and pH adjusted using 1 M NaOH/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

Ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 M&#8486;.

cm was used as the solvent in all preparations. The approximate size of these

silver nanoparticles was found to be ca. 3-8

nm. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that the hydrophobic part and amide

functionality of casein is involved in the stabilization of silver

nanoparticles (Ashraf et al., 2013).</p>


<h4>2.1.2.      Synthesis of Citrate Stabilized Silver Nanoparticles (S2)</h4>





<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This method

is with slight modifications in the classical

citrate reduction method by Turkevich et al. (1951) for

nanoparticle synthesis. To an aqueous solution of 1mM AgNO<sub>3</sub>, 1mM

tri-sodium citrate solution was added and stirred for 2 hours. After 2 hours 5 mL

NaBH<sub>4</sub> solution (0.8 mg/l mL) was added during stirring at room

temperature. The reaction was allowed to complete for 5 hours. The particle

solution was filter purified to remove access ligand and other impurities using

centrifuge filters (Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal

Filters by Millipore Corporation) having a molecular weight cut off value of 30

KDa, and then stored at room temperature for further

analysis and use in subsequent experiments. The approximate size of these

silver nanoparticles was found to be ca. 4-8

nm and pH was between 7

to 8.</p>


<h4>2.1.3.      Synthesis of a Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) Stabilized Silver Nanoparticles (S3)
</h4>




<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">            In a typical

experiment to prepare polymer (PHMB) functionalized silver nanoparticles, a

given volume (15 mL, 20 &#956;g/mL) of PHMB solution,

was added to an aqueous solution of 1mM AgNO<sub>3</sub> under vigorous

stirring. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir vigorously for 2 hours to

let polymer form a complex with silver. Freshly prepared aqueous solution of

sodium borohydride (5 mL, 0.8 mg/mL) was then added

quickly to the polymer-Ag solution and the reaction was allowed to complete for

5 hours. The yellow/brownish suspension of sliver nanoparticles was then filter

purified to remove excess polymer and other impurities using centrifuge filters

(Amicon<sup>®</sup> Ultra Centrifugal Filters by

Millipore Corporation) having a molecular weight cut off value of 30 KDa, and then stored at room temperature for further

analysis and use in subsequent experiments. <span lang=EN-US style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

font-family:"Cambria","serif";mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:

Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>PHMB (20% <i>w</i>/<i>v</i>)

was purchased from Arch Chemicals (Norwalk, CT, USA). The approximate size of these silver nanoparticles was found to be

ca. </i>5-9 nm. FTIR spectroscopy

indicated the interaction of imine group of PHMB with nanoparticles confirming its

functionalization with PHMB (Ashraf et al., 2012).</p>


<h4>2.2.           Characterization of Silver Nanoparticles</h4>




<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">           The silver

nanoparticles were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy in the range of 300

to 800 nm. All the three preparations have a clear surface plasmon

resonance band. The particles produced by borohydride

reduction in the presence of sodium citrate seem relatively more uniform as

indicated by the narrow absorption band. </p>

<br>




<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Three

samples of different particle sizes (S1= 3-8 nm, S2= 4-8 nm and S3 = 5-9 nm)

used in this study with three different concentrations 60, 77 and 26 µg/mL of

Ag nanoparticles in the solutions respectively.</p>


<h4>2.3.           Bacterial Strains</h4>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Bacterial strains were isolated from water supply of different

sectors of Islamabad and identified by API 20E method.  These include <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Enterobacter</i> cloaceae</i>, Escherichia coli,</i> Pseudomonas

aeruginosa</i>, <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cronobacter</i> sakazakii</i>, <i>Pantoea</i><i> agglomeran, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas hydrophila </i>and

Klebsiella</i><i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> pneumoniae.</i></p>



<h4>2.4.           Bioassay</h4>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles was tested in

triplicate by using agar well diffusion method (Perez et al., 1990). 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> Colony Forming Units (CFU/ml) of each

microorganismwas

inoculated on Muller Hinton (MH) agar. Working volume 120 µL of

different Ag nanoparticle sample was used with 100 µL of distilled water as

control. Diameter of zones of inhibition was noted after 24 hrs

of incubation at 37 °C.</p>



<h2>3. Results</h2>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) was tested against different Gram negative

waterborne bacterial strains which were isolated from water supply of Islamabad

working under Capital Development Authority (CDA). Casein stabilized (S1) and Citrate

stabilized (S2) silver nanoparticles showed activity against various water

borne bacterial strains. To find out the effect of different surface ligands of

Ag NPs on bacteria, the concentration difference was eliminated by normalizing

the results to the particle concentration. Casein stabilized particles (S1) were

more effective than citrate stabilized particles (S2) against all the tested

bacterial strains as shown in Figure 2.</p><br />

<figcaption>
Figure 2. Diameter of Zones of Inhibition (DZI) in millimeter (mm) of different Ag NPs against drinking water bacteria.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Antibacterial activity of S1 and S2 varied from 9.3 to 14.9 mm for

different bacterial strains. Previously different studies were carried out on

antibacterial activity of Ag NPs (Savithramma et al.,

2011; Ruparelia et al., 2008) but due to different particles size, method of preparation

and initial bacterial concentration used, direct comparison is difficult.  S2 showed 12.3 mm inhibition zone against <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>E. coli</i> and 12.6 mm against <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>C. sakazakii</i>. Theivasanthi and Alagar (2011)

also studied the effect of silver nanoparticles (24 nm particle size) against <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>E. coli</i> and reported 12 mm zones of

inhibition.  Furthermore, S2 showed 12 mm

and 11.6 mm inhibition zones against K. pneumoniae </i>and P.

aeruginosa </i>respectively. Prasad et al. (2011)

reported a 6 mm zone of inhibition against K.

pneumoniae</i> when they used silver nanoparticles of

59 nm produced phytogenically. Another antibacterial

study of silver nanoparticles produced from three different medicinal plants

showed 12, 7 and 12 mm zones of inhibition against <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Klebsiella</i> and 9, 6, 15 mm

inhibition zones against Pseudomonas </i>(Savithramma et al., 2011). The variation in results is most

likely due to different particle sizes and methods used for synthesis of silver

nanoparticles. S1 particles showed better activity than S2 against all the

tested strains of bacteria. </p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>E. coli</i> was most effectively inhibited with 14.9 mm zone of inhibition

and A. hydrophila

was observed to be the most resistant against silver nanoparticles among the

eight Gram negative bacteria tested. S3 showed no activity. Our results have

shown good relevance with the previous literature although direct comparison is

difficult due to differences of parameters regarding the use of initial

bacterial count and amount of Ag NPs tested.</p>


<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We evaluated the effect of surface stabilizers of silver nanoparticles

between the range of 3-10 nm on the waterborne

bacterial strains. Citrate stabilized silver nanoparticles and Casein

stabilized silver nanoparticles showed antibacterial activity against all the

tested strains. The biocidal action of citrate stabilized

particles against multidrug resistant bacteria is known (Borah et al., 2012). <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>C. sakazakii</i>

(12.6 mm) was most sensitive to citrate stabilized particles, followed by <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>E. coli</i> (12.3 mm), K. pneumoniae</i>

(12 mm) and P. aeruginosa</i>

(11.6 mm). Casein stabilized particles (Sample 1) have shown marked antibacterial

effect as compared to citrate stabilized particles. Therefore, it can be

concluded that casein is a better surface ligand in terms of antibacterial

effect as compared to citrate, E. coli</i>

being the most effectively inhibited with 14.9 mm zone of inhibition.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i> Enterobacter cloaceae, Pantoea agglomerans and Cronobacter sakazakii 

</i>were tested for the first time to our knowledge. A detailed

study is, however, required for the production of silver nanoparticles with

better surface stabilizers for improved antibacterial activity. Further, the

effect of the shape of the Ag nanoparticles against the bacterial strains used

is under investigation. Polymer stabilized silver nanoparticles (S3) showed no

activity against any strain tested. This might be due to low concentration (26 µg/mL) of silver nanoparticles in the sample. Other similar studies reported the antibacterial

activity of silver nanoparticles. Bankura et al.

(2012) studied the antimicrobial activity of dextran

stabilized silver nanoparticles in aqueous medium and they reported the

significant reduction of bacteria, Bacillus

subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli,

Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Another study by Ashraf et al. (2012) reported

the antibacterial activity of Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)

functionalized silver nanoparticles against <i>E.

coli</i>.


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Further investigations are under process and we plan to study Ag nanoparticle

incorporated clay filters which are cheap and commercially affordable for low

income group people for the provision of clean drinking water, particularly in

rural areas. We believe that this study is important for the public,

particularly in the developing countries and also for others working in the
