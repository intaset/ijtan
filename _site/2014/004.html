<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
Recent articles underline the potential health risks associated to the "nano"
revolution. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO<sub>2</sub>) are one of
these engineered nanoparticles (ENP) that have been cautioned about their likely
harmful effects on health. In occupational use, to handle ENP, many Health
&amp; Safety agencies have recommended the application of the precautionary
principle namely the recommendation of the use of protective gloves against
chemicals. However, at the best of our knowledge, no study about the
penetration of ENP through protective gloves in working conditions was
performed. This study
was designed to evaluate the efficiency of several models of protective gloves
against nTiO<sub>2</sub>.
Two types of nitrile rubber gloves (100 &micro;m and 200&micro;m), latex
and butyl rubber gloves were brought into contact with nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water, in
propylene glycol (PG) or in powder. Mechanical biaxial deformations (BD),
simulating the flexing of the hand, were applied
to the samples during their exposure to ENP. Depending the model of
gloves and the mode of application of the NP, the results obtained by ICP-MS
(Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry) are different. For nTiO<sub>2</sub>
in water, the passage is highlighted for nitrile rubber gloves (100 &micro;m) after
only 60 deformations and the nTiO<sub>2</sub> concentration reaches its maximum
for 180 BD. Regarding the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in powder, nitrile rubber gloves
(100 &micro;m) and butyl rubber, the values achieved are significant but less than
the solutions.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
increasing use of ENP in commercial products and industrial processes make
their occupational exposures inevitable [1, 2]. Indeed, the global
market for nanotechnologies will attain over 2.5 trillion dollars in 2020 [3] and at the same time, the workers and the
researchers in this industry will reach 6 million persons [4]. Concerning nTiO<sub>2</sub>, they are increasingly
present in several commercial products like paints, varnishes, sunscreens, etc.
[5, 6]. But recently, the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified nanosized
titanium dioxide in 2B-group as possibly carcinogenic to humans [7]. This
decision follows numerous studies caution about their likely harmful effects on
health. For
example, a small increase in the number of cancer among workers in contact with
nTiO<sub>2</sub> has been reported [8]. Moreover,
study conducted on hairless mice and porcine skin after subchronic dermal
exposure to nTiO<sub>2</sub> have shown that the ENP can be located in deep
layer of epidermis [9]. After 60
days dermal exposure, nTiO<sub>2</sub> reach different tissues and pathological
lesions can be observed. Others studies indicated the penetration of ENP
through intact or damaged human skin [10-12]. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
response to IARC's classification, several Health &amp; Safety
government agencies have recommended the application of the
precautionary principle [13,14=] like the use
of protective gloves against chemicals even if no thorough scientific
validation of their efficiency against nanoparticles has been made yet.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">At the best of our knowledge, three
groups
have reported research carried out on protective gloves against nanoparticles
but most of it involves aerosols. In 2008, Golanski et al has reported the
diffusion of 30 and 80 nm graphite nanoparticles through nitrile, vinyl, latex
and neoprene commercial glove samples [15] then a year later, the
same group measured no penetration for the same gloves with 40 nm graphite and
10 nm TiO<sub>2</sub> and Pt particles (Golanski et al. 2009). In 2010, Park et
al. studied the penetration of silver nanoaerosols (AgNP) through nitrile
rubber and latex gloves using the same experimental setup than Golanski (Park
et al., 2011). The authors have concluded to a non-penetration of AgNP through
latex and nitrile rubber protective gloves. All these results seem conflicting.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Exposure
to nanoparticles in occupational settings may also involve solutions. This
situation is especially relevant to protective gloves. Vinches et al. exposed nitrile glove
samples to nTiO<sub>2</sub>
solution in water with dynamic deformations simulating flexing [16,17]. ICP-MS analyses
of sampling solutions suggest the penetration of the nitrile gloves when they
were subjected to dynamic mechanical deformations for periods of 5 hours or
more.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This paper evaluates the efficiency of four
common models of protective gloves against nTiO<sub>2</sub> in solutions or in
powder in conditions simulating occupational use. </p>

<h2>2. Materials</h2>

<h4>2. 1. Protective Gloves</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Four models of protective gloves corresponding
to three types of elastomers were selected for this study: disposable latex
gloves (100 &micro;m thick - Microflex, Reno, NV), disposable nitrile rubber gloves
(100 and 200 &micro;m thick - Showa Best Glove, Coaticook, QC) respectively
identified as NBR-100 and NBR-200, and butyl rubber gloves were also used (350
&micro;m thick - Showa Best Glove, Coaticook, QC). All the samples were taken from
back and the palm section of the gloves.</p>



<h4>2. 2. Nanoparticles</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">nTiO<sub>2</sub> is labelled as 99.7% pure
anatase with an average particle size of 15 nm. Two types of nTiO<sub>2
</sub>solutions were employed: in water (15 wt%, Nanostructured &amp; Amorphous
Materials, Inc., Houston, TX) and in 1,2-propanediol, PG (20 wt%, MK Impex,
Mississauga, ON). nTiO<sub>2</sub> in powder were also used (Nanostructured
&amp; Amorphous Materials, Inc., Houston, TX).</p>



<h2>3. Methods</h2>

<h4>3. 1. Characterization
of the nTiO<sub>2</sub></h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A series of experiments were performed to
characterize the nanoparticles solution. Firstly, analysis of the nTiO<sub>2</sub>
native stock solution (following dilution to 10 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) by
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) gave a hydrodynamic diameter [18,19]. Secondly,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Diamond TGA/DTA Perkin Elmer) was used to
evaluate the mass ratio of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> and to identify the presence of
chemicals in the colloidal solutions, in addition to the liquid carrier.
Gradual evaporation of the liquid carrier occurred between 25 and 150 &deg;C with a
step of 5&deg;C/min [19]. Finally, similar
comparisons were performed for the technical grade and ultra-high purity
solvents and the nTiO<sub>2</sub> suspensions using Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet Continuum XL). Measurements were made in
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode, between 500 and 4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>,
on drops of solutions after almost total evaporation of the solvent [19]. To obtain
statistically significant data, triplicate measurements were performed for all
tests.</p>



<h4>3. 2. Characterization of
the Protective Gloves</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The surface morphology of five samples for each
elastomer was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S3600N -
Vacc = 15 kV - magnification &times; 1000) (Vinches et al. 2013). A gold layer is
deposited by metallization on the samples. The conductive layer obtained with a
vacuum metallizer has a controlled uniform thickness (15 nm) over the entire
sample's surface. Some characteristic features can be observed on the gloves
surface: micrometer-size pores for nitrile rubber, cracks for latex and
platelets for butyl rubber gloves. The quantification of the surface area of
these features was performed using the software ImageJ (image processing).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In the same time, a XPS (X-ray photoelectron
spectrometry) modulus is employed to perform chemical analyses of the glove
materials, particularly to evaluate the presence or absence of titanium
dioxide, used as reinforcing fillers (Mellstrom and Bowan 2005).</p>



<h4>3. 3. Mechanical Deformations
Experimental Setup</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For the purpose of this study, a test setup has
been developed and is illustrated in Fig. 1. It includes an exposure chamber
and a sampling chamber, which are separated by the sample. Both chambers and
all elements in contact with NP are made of ultrahigh molecular weight
polyethylene to limit the effect of adsorption of nTiO<sub>2</sub> in solution.
The setup has been designed to allow exposing glove samples to both NP when
simultaneously subjecting them to dynamic mechanical constraints. nTiO<sub>2</sub>
are introduced (6 mL nTiO<sub>2</sub> solution and 250 mg for nTiO<sub>2</sub>
in powder) in the exposure chamber and put in contact with the external surface
of the glove samples. As shown in Fig. 1, the test setup is also equipped with
a probe linked to an electronic system for controlling mechanical deformations
to the sample. The system is computer controlled and includes a 200-N load cell
and a position detector. The whole system is enclosed in a glove box to ensure
the operator safety during assembly, dismounting and clean-up operations as
well as during the tests.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The time profile of sample deformations
corresponding to the results reported in this paper is a 50% deformation every
minute. The maximum of BD is fixed to 180 for NBR-100, NBR-200 and latex
gloves. In fact, this value corresponds approximately to 3-hours wearing time.
Normally, after this time these gloves models should be discarded. Concerning
butyl rubber gloves (non-disposable gloves) the maximum of BD is fixed to 420
(7-hours wearing time).</p>

<h4>3. 4. ICP-MS Analysis</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
preparation of the sampling solutions for ICP-MS (PerkinElmer NexION 300X) analyzes was
performed following a protocol established by Shaw et al. [20]. Firstly, to
minimize adsorption phenomena, aggregation and agglomeration, all sample
solutions were stirred vigorously and placed in an ultrasonic bath (Branson
model 5510) for 20 minutes. Secondly, 4 mL of sampling solution is acidified to
2% with the addition of 150 &micro;L of pure nitric acid (Fluka Analytical , HNO<sub>3</sub>
&#8805; 65%, the presence of Ti &#8804; 0.01 mg / kg). Finally, 1 mL of a
10%-Triton X-100 is added. Triton X- 100 is a non-ionic surfactant in liquid
form. According to Shaw, Triton X-100 facilitates the nTiO<sub>2</sub>
dispersion in the matrix. Before being analyzed by ICP- MS, each sample was
stirred during 10 seconds.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">ICP-MS
does not measure directly nTiO<sub>2</sub> concentration ([nTiO<sub>2</sub>])
but the concentration of Ti<sup>4+</sup> ([Ti<sup>4+</sup>]). Indeed, after the
introduction of the sampling solution, nTiO<sub>2</sub> are ionized according
to Equation (1) that is corresponding in molar concentration terms at the
Equation (2).</p>

<div class="eqn-number">(2)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">ICP-MS
give mass concentration expressed in &micro;g/L. To convert molar concentration to
mass concentration, we must multiply the molar concentration by the molar mass
of chemical compound as Equation (3):</p>

<div class="eqn">

<div class="eqn-number">(3)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">With
<img src="004_files/image015.png"> and <img src="004_files/image016.png">. So, a proportional relationship can be established
between the mass concentrations of nTiO<sub>2</sub> and Ti<sup>4+</sup>
(Equation (4)):</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="004_files/image017.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(4)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
addition, titanium has five naturally occurring isotopes. ICP-MS measure
simultaneously the concentrations of four of them: <sup>46</sup>Ti, <sup>47</sup>Ti,
<sup>48</sup>Ti, <sup>49</sup>Ti. To minimize interference with other chemical groups, for example <img src="004_files/image018.png">group, only the concentrations of <sup>47</sup>Ti
are retained.</p>



<h2>4. Result and Discussion</h2>

<h4>4. 1. Characterization
of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> Solutions</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">FCS
analyses were performed to measure the hydrodynamic diameter of the nTiO<sub>2</sub>
solutions. 21 &plusmn; 2 nm were obtained for nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water [19]. The same analysis was
not possible for the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in PG due to an incompatibility between
the cell material and the colloidal solution liquid carrier. Thermogravimetric
analyses were also carried out to estimate the nTiO<sub>2</sub> mass fractions.
The mass fraction obtained for nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water is 14.3 &plusmn; 0.8 % and
25.0 &plusmn; 3.7 % for nTiO<sub>2</sub> in PG [19]. These results
confirmed the manufacturer data. In addition, FT-IR analyses were performed to
bring out the presence of additives such as stabilizing agents. An additional
peak appears at 1070 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water (no
shown) compared to the spectrum of milli-Q water [19]. This peak may be
associated with the elongation of a CO bond. It might indicate the presence of
an alcohol or ether used as additive in the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solution. On the
other hand, the spectra of nTiO<sub>2</sub> in PG and the ultra pure PG do not
disclose any significant difference. In these cases, spectra exhibit a complex
structure which explains the difficulty in detecting additional peaks
associated with the presence of additives.</p>

<h4>4. 2. Characterization
of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> Powder</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
size distribution of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> was measured by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) and verified by statistical analysis of 174
particles. Two allotropic forms of TiO<sub>2</sub> were observed: a spherical
anatase and a rod-like rutile (Fig 2(a)).
Analysis by X-ray diffraction (Philips X'PERT) confirmed the presence of 3 to
6% rutile in the nTiO<sub>2</sub>. Fig 2(b) displays
the size distribution of the analysed sample in terms of circular diameter. It
can be seen that the average dimension of the particles/aggregates was situated
around 100 nm, although even some micrometric-size agglomerates were recorded.
In fact, only two particles with a diameter lower than 20 nm were counted.</p>

<h4>4.3.Characterization
of the Protective Gloves Surface</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Micrometer-size
surface features which can be observed on the outer surface (surface in contact
with the nTiO<sub>2</sub>) of all the protective gloves (Figure 3). For both
nitrile rubber gloves, the surface features corresponding to pores, cracks for
latex glove and platelets for butyl rubber gloves. These surface features may
facilitate the penetration of nTiO<sub>2</sub> through protective gloves [21].</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">XPS chemical analyses of the glove material have
been made. Triplicate measurements were performed for all analyses. The mass
concentrations of titanium measured are (0.44 &plusmn; 0.08) for NBR-100 and (0.73 &plusmn;
0.14). No trace of titanium is detected for latex and butyl rubber gloves. To
ensure that the titanium concentration in the sampling chamber is due to the
passage of nTiO<sub>2</sub> and not to the glove degradation, some tests were
performed without NP.</p>



<h4>4. 4. ICP-MS Results</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
variation of Ti<sup>4+</sup> concentration in the sampling solutions as a
function of the number of deformations is reported in Figure 4 and
corresponding to NBR-100 samples in contact or not with nTiO<sub>2</sub>
solutions. To obtain statistically significant data, triplicate measurements
were performed for all analyses. Initial tests were performed
&#8203;&#8203;without nTiO<sub>2</sub> to determine the possible contamination
by titanium content in nitrile rubber gloves. The average value of Ti<sup>4+</sup>
concentration is 0.4 &micro;g/L (dashed line in Figure 4). Similarly,
in the presence of nTiO<sub>2</sub> in PG, no penetration of NP is remarkable.
This result indicates that NBR-100 is efficient against the penetration nTiO<sub>2</sub>
in PG under work conditions. By cons, for nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water, the
maximum value of Ti<sup>4+</sup> concentration is reached for 180 DB (2590
&micro;g/L). According to the Equation (4), nTiO<sub>2</sub> concentration is 4320
&micro;g/L. It may be noted that nTiO<sub>2</sub> concentration is 12.8 &micro;g/L after 60
BD and 271.9 &micro;g/L after 120 BD. This result can be explained by a progressive
deterioration of these protective gloves. No significant Ti<sup>4+</sup>
concentration was measured for NBR-200, latex and butyl gloves in contact with
nTiO<sub>2</sub> in solutions.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Same
tests were performed with nTiO<sub>2</sub> in powder. In this case, no
major Ti<sup>4+</sup> concentration was measured for NBR-200 and latex gloves.
By cons, for butyl rubber, Ti<sup>4+</sup> concentration reached 10.9 &micro;g/L
after 420 BD (Figure 5). Similarly,
a significant increase in Ti<sup>4+</sup> concentration was detected with
NBR-100. However, these results should be confirmed because the protocol
established by Shaw et al. [20] gives a
yield of 45% with nTiO<sub>2</sub> in powder whereas it reaches 85% with nTiO<sub>2</sub>
in solutions.</p>

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This
work has experimentally evaluated the efficiency of protective gloves against
the nTiO<sub>2</sub> under work conditions. The results are different depending
on the glove models and the nTiO<sub>2</sub> application mode. Table 1 summarizes the
efficiency of all the protective gloves studied against nTiO<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In
the case of NBR-200, the thickness has a major role as barrier whereas for
latex gloves, the chemical composition seems to be the main actor in the efficiency.
Some tests are needed to confirm the results obtained with nTiO<sub>2</sub> in
powder. So we need for further investigations but for the moment, great care
must be taken in selecting protective gloves for the handling nTiO<sub>2</sub>.
It is already possible to recommend a frequent replacement of gloves in case of
exposure to nTiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
