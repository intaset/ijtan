<h2>1. Introduction</h2>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Titanium dioxide

nanoparticles (nTiO<sub>2</sub>) are increasingly present in commercial

products such as paints, varnishes, sunscreens, etc. [1, 2]. The global production

of nTiO<sub>2</sub> was 50,400 tons in 2010 and is expected to reach 201,500

tons in 2015 (Future Markets 2011). As a result, the exposure of workers and

researchers to nTiO<sub>2</sub> is expected to rapidly increase. At the same

time, an increasing number of studies are expressing concern about the likely

harmful effects of nTiO<sub>2</sub> on human health. For example, a small increase in the

number of cancers among workers who were in contact with nTiO<sub>2</sub> has

been reported [3]. Moreover, for studies conducted by intratracheal

instillation of rats and mice to 250 nm TiO<sub>2</sub> pigments and 20 nm nTiO<sub>2</sub>,

inflammation of the lungs was higher for the nanoparticulate form of TiO<sub>2</sub>

[4-6]. Following these results, the International Agency for Research on Cancer

(IARC) classified nanosized titanium dioxide as being possibly carcinogenic to

humans (i.e. 2B group, [7]). In response to this classification, several government agencies responsible for the health and safety of workers hav recommended application of he precautionary principle [8, 9]. One of

their recommendations is the use of protective gloves and clothing when working

with nanoparticles, even though no scientific validation of their efficiency has

yet been made.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A

limited number of groups have reported research on the use of protective gloves

for nanoparticles. Much of the research has involved nanoaerosols and, in some cases,

conflicting results have been found. Diffusion of 30 and 80 nm graphite

nanoparticles through nitrile, vinyl, latex and neoprene commercial glove

samples has been reported [10], while no penetration was later measured for the

same gloves when exposed to 40 nm graphite, 10 nm TiO<sub>2</sub> or 10 nm Pt

particles [11, 12]. Nonetheless, under occupational settings, nanoparticles may be found as

colloidal suspensions. This situation is especially relevant to protective gloves.

For example, Vinches et al. exposed samples of nitrile, latex and neoprene gloves to nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions in

water while deforming

the gloves by simulating flexing [13, 14].Analyses by inductively coupled plasma mass

spectrometry (ICP-MS)

suggested that nTiO<sub>2</sub>

was able to penetrate

through the protective gloves when they were subjected to dynamic mechanical

deformations for a period of 5 hours or more. In addition to mechanical

deformation, the swelling of gloves materials might be facilitate the

penetration of nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions through protective gloves [15].</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This paper reports analysis of some

physical and mechanical phenomena which may facilitate the penetration of nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions through nitrile rubber and

latex protective gloves submitted to biaxial deformations. These results were

obtained using commercial colloidal solutions of 15 nm nTiO<sub>2</sub> in

water and in 1,2-propanediol.</p>

<h2>2. Materials</h2>


<h4>2. 1. Protective Gloves</h4>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Three models of protective gloves

corresponding to two types of elastomers were selected for this study:

disposable 100 and 200 µm thick nitrile rubber gloves (identified as NBR-100

and NBR-200 respectively), and disposable 100 µm thick latex gloves. All

samples were taken from back and palm sections of the gloves.</p>


<h4>2. 2. Nanoparticles</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles have been

chosen in this study because of their widespread use. The nTiO<sub>2</sub> (15 nm, anatase) was

suspended in two solutions: water (15 wt%, Nanostructured &amp; Amorphous

Materials, Inc., Houston, TX) and in 1,2-propanediol, PG (20 wt%, MK Impex,

Mississauga, ON).</p>


<h2>3. Methods</h2>

<h4>3. 1. Characterization of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> Solutions</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A series of experiments were performed to

characterize the nanoparticle solutions. First, the analysis of the nTiO<sub>2</sub>

stock solution following dilution to 10 mg L<sup>-1</sup> was performed by

fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in order to give the hydrodynamic

diameter [16]. Second, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Diamond TGA/DTA Perkin

Elmer) was used to evaluate the mass ratio of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> and identify

the presence of additives in the colloidal solutions, aside from the liquid

carrier. Gradual evaporation of the liquid carrier occurred between 25 and 150

ºC at a heating rate of 5°C/min. Finally, comparisons

were made among the nTiO<sub>2</sub>

carrier solutions and the technical

grade and ultra-high purity solvents that were used as the liquid carriers by

analysing spectra obtained using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet

Continuum XL). Measurements were made in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode,

between 500 and 4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>, on

drops of solutions after near total solvent evaporation.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To obtain statistically significant data, triplicate

measurements were performed for all analyses.</span></p>


<h4>3. 2. Experimental Setup for the Mechanical Deformations</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The

test setup used for this study is illustrated in Figure 1. It includes an exposure chamber and a sampling chamber,

which are separated by the glove sample. Both chambers and all elements that

come in contact with the nTiO<sub>2</sub> are made of ultrahigh molecular weight

polyethylene in order to limit the adsorption of nTiO<sub>2</sub> as

documented by FCS. nTiO<sub>2

</sub>are introduced into the exposure chamber, in direct contact with the

external surface of the glove samples.  The

setup has been designed in order to expose the glove samples to colloidal

solutions of nTiO<sub>2</sub>, while simultaneously subjecting them to

static or dynamic mechanical constraints. Indeed, the test setup was equipped with a probe linked to an electronic system for

applying static or dynamic mechanical stress to the sample (Figure 1).The system is computer controlled and

includes a 200-N load cell and a position detector. The whole system is enclosed in a glove

box to ensure operator safety during the assembly, dismounting and clean-up

operations as well as during the tests. The

time profile of sample deformations is illustrated in Figure 2 a and involved applying a<i> </i>50%

deformation every minute. The probe head used in this study is shown in Figure 2b. It corresponded to a conical-spherical

geometry that simulates biaxial deformations (BD) similar to that produced in

gloves when flexing the hand [17].</p>

<h4>3. 3. Quantification of the Characteristic Features on the Glove Surface</h4>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The surface morphology of five samples

for each elastomer, was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi

S3600N – Vacc = 15 kV – magnification &times; 1000). Quantification of the surface

area of the primary features (pores for nitrile and cracks for latex) was

performed using image processing software (ImageJ).</p>


<h4>3. 4. Strain Energy </h4>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Stress-strain curves, corresponding to

the applied 50% dynamic deformation during tests, were plotted in order to

follow the variation of the strain energy. An estimation of the relative strain

energy was carried out by computing the area under the curves using the

trapezoidal method.</p>

<h4>3. 5. Determination of the Degree of Crystallinity</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A semi-crystalline polymer is

composed of crystallites dispersed in an amorphous matrix. Each of these two phases

gives a particular diffraction signal [18]. X-ray diffraction profiles were

obtained using a Pananalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer in the scanning range

of 2-50º and a Cu K<span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol'>a</span> radiation (45 kV, 40 mA). The

degree of crystallinity (<i>&#967;</i>) was

calculated as the ratio of the area under the crystalline peaks divided by the

total area under all peaks in the diffraction profile [19], Eq.

(1):-</p>

<h4>3. 6. Length Change Measurements </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Length change measurements were performed

on 5 × 60 mm rectangular samples taken from the back or the palm section of the

gloves. To obtain statistically significant data, three replicates were evaluated

for each test. The measurements were performed by immersing the samples in the

commercial nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions. At regular intervals, samples were

removed from the liquid, their surface gently wiped with a paper towel and

lengths measured using a calliper (±0.01 mm). Length change data were computed

using Eq. (2):</p>

<h2>4. Results and Discussion</h2>
<h4>4. 1. Characterization of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> Solutions</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">FCS analyses were performed to measure the

hydrodynamic diameter of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in the two solutions. In water,

the hydrodynamic diameter ranged from 19 nm to 23 nm, while in PG, the analysis

was not possible due to an incompatibility between the FCS cells and the solvent.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The relative mass loss was measured as a

function of temperature for the PG and for the PG containing nTiO<sub>2 </sub>(Figure

3). In the presence of nTiO<sub>2</sub>, the curve was slightly shifted towards

higher temperatures as compared to its absence. This observation can be attributed

to the adsorption of solvent molecules by the nanoparticles, thus increasing

the vapour pressure of the system [15]. In the case of nTiO<sub>2</sub> in

water, the effect was also observed, but with a smaller amplitude. The calculated

mass fraction obtained for nTiO<sub>2</sub> was 14.3 ± 0.8 % in water and 25.0

± 3.7 % in PG. These results are in agreement with the manufacturer's indications.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">FT-IR analyses were performed to see if

additives, such as stabilizing agents, were present in the nTiO<sub>2</sub>

solutions (Figure 4).  A peak appearing at 1070 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the water used

to suspend the nTiO<sub>2</sub> was not observed in Milli-Q water (18.2

M&#937;.cm of resistivity and Total Organic Carbon less than 1 µg.L<sup>-1</sup>).

This peak was associated with the elongation of a CO bond, likely indicative of

a surfactant additive in the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solution. In contrast, the FTIR

spectra of the PG used to suspend the nTiO<sub>2</sub> did not differ

significantly from reagent grade PG. Nonetheless, spectra were admittedly complex,

making the detection of additional peaks difficult.</p>

<h4>4. 2. Characterization of the Surface of the Protective Gloves</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Micrometer-size pores could be observed

on the surface of the gloves (Figure 5), as already reported in the literature [20].

Indeed, micrometer-size pores were observed on both the inner and outer surfaces

of both models of the nitrile glove. For the latex, micrometer-size cracks were

seen on both surfaces.</p>

<h4>4. 3. Swelling of Glove Materials in nTiO<sub>2</sub> Solutions</h4>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In

order to investigate the cause of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> penetration through

protective gloves, the swelling of nitrile rubber and latex was studied by

recording the length change of samples after immersion in nTiO<sub>2</sub>

solutions. Figure 6 displays a gradual length change

increase for the two nitriles immersed in the aqueous nTiO<sub>2</sub>,

indicating significant diffusion of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solution into the

elastomer. A larger swelling ratio was recorded for NBR-100. For example, after

3 hours of immersion, the length change ratio for the NBR-100 was 4% whereas it

was 2% for the NBR-200 (Table 1). It should be noted that maximum swelling was

not attained for either of the two nitrile rubber gloves after 3 hours of

immersion. For the NBR-100, a plateau was reached after 20 hours of immersion,

with a maximum swelling of 9%. For the NBR-200, a maximum swelling of 12% was

observed after 8 days of immersion. The difference in behaviour between the two

models of nitrile rubber can be attributed to possible differences in the

penetration of water, which may induce different affinities to the colloidal

solution. According to the Table

1, the difference in

swelling between NBR and latex glove may well the primary reasons that the

aqueous nTiO<sub>2</sub> was able to more easily penetrate the NBR [21].</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 6. Length change ratio as a function of immersion time in aqueous nTiO<sub>2</sub> for the two nitrile rubber glove models.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The

values of the length change ratio after 3 hours of immersion are provided in Table 1. The same tendency was observed for each

of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions: NBR-100 swelled more than NBR-200 and latex.

A large difference was also observed between the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions:

nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water induced swelling faster than the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in

PG for all of the studied glove materials. This difference in swelling behavior

produced by the two solutions can be attributed to differences in their ability

to penetrate (diffuse) into the elastomer.</p>

<h4>4. 4. Effect of the Mechanical Deformations and the Ntio<sub>2</sub> Solutions on the Gloves</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The

sample glove surface morphology was first characterized following exposure to

the dynamic biaxial deformations (BD) in the absence of the nTiO<sub>2</sub>

solutions. Figure 7 displays the variation of the surface

features as a function of the number of deformations for NBR-100. While no

significant effect was recorded on the inner surface, the outer surface appeared

to be strongly affected by the mechanical deformations. Indeed, an increase in the

surface area attributed to the pores was observed after only 30 BD, increasing

by more than three-fold after 180 BD. The same observations could be made for the

outer surface of the latex glove. In contrast, NBR-200 was much less affected

than either the NBR-100 or latex. In those cases, the deterioration of the

materials could be attributed to an abrasion of the sample surface by the probe

[22]. This hypothesis was supported by the observation of a reduction in

surface features when the mechanical deformations were performed in the

presence of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions (see Figure 8),which

might have played the role of a lubricating agent.</p>

<br>


<h4>4. 5. Variation in the Strain Energy</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A

second mechanical test involved measuring the relative strain energy during

each deformation. As shown in, an important decrease in the

relative strain energy was observed during the first deformations.  Thereafter,

values reached a plateau, which can be attributed to the Mullins effect.

Indeed, some polymer chains reach their limit of extensibility and break during

the first deformations, which reduces the energy required to deform the sample during

the next cycles [23]. In the absence of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions, the

variation of the relative strain energy as a function of the number of

deformations was similar for the NBR-100 and NBR-200 samples. In the presence

of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions, the energy required to deform the sample was

less important because the elastomer membrane was weakened by its swelling [15].

As it will be shown in section 4.3, NBR-100 swells more than NBR-200 for a similar

immersion time, which can explain the difference between plateaus obtained for

the two materials, i.e. relative strain energy is low when the swelling of the

sample is important. For the NBR-100, results were similar for both solvents

(data not shown). On the other hand, for the NBR-200, the variation of the relative

strain energy was similar for the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in PG and those generated in

the absence of the nanoparticles, i.e. the swelling of the NBR-200 that was in

contact with the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in PG was insignificant. Moreover, only the nTiO<sub>2</sub>

in water affected the variation of the relative strain energy of latex samples

after 80 BD (Figure 10).</p>

<h4>4. 6. Effect of Mechanical Deformations and

the nTiO<sub>2</sub> Solutions on the Degree of Crystallinity</h4>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Mechanical deformations can lead to a

modification in the degree of crystallinity of elastomers [18]. Indeed, the

degree of crystallinity (DOC) is a function of the elongation [24]. To

highlight this phenomenon, X-ray

diffraction was used in order to evaluate the DOC of glove materials that were subjected

to mechanical strains in the presence of

the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions. In Figure 11, an X-ray diffraction profile of a native

NBR-100 samples and one exposed to 180 BD and aqueous nTiO<sub>2</sub> in

water. An important decrease in the intensity can be observed after 180 biaxial

deformations in presence of the nTiO<sub>2</sub> in water.</p>

<figure>
<img src="001_files/image013.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 11. X-ray diffraction profile of the native NBR-100 samples and those exposed to

180 BD in the presence of the aqueous nTiO<sub>2</sub>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For the NBR-100, the decrease in the degree of

crystallinity reached 35% after 180 BD (Figure 12). Complementary XRD analyses showed

that the DOC reached this value after only 30 BD (data not shown). As was

observed with the strain energy measurements, this decrystallization could be

attributed to a polymer chain rupture during the initial

deformations, i.e. Mullins effect. The observed

decrystallization under stress appeared to be amplified as a result of the contact with the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions. For example, in the

presence of the aqueous nTiO<sub>2</sub>, the DOC decreased by 44% for the NBR-100

and a similar trend was observed for NBR-200. This increase in the decrystallization

could be attributed to plasticisers having leached out of the elastomers when they

were swollen by the liquid carrier [25]. This would induce a fragilization of

the elastomer chain network after solvent evaporation, which would lead the

polymer to become more sensitive to decrystallization under stress. On the

other hand, for latex, the DOC measured appeared to be unaffected by the

application of BD. </p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Based upon the above results, penetration

of nanoparticles through protective glove materials, under conditions

simulating occupational use, can attributed in part to a degradation of the physical

and mechanical properties of the elastomer that is accelerated by repetitive

mechanical deformations and by contact with the nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions. This paper has investigated the physical

phenomena behind this facilitated penetration of nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions. To simulate realistic work

conditions encountered by protective gloves, one 50% biaxial deformation per

minute was applied over 3 hours. It was observed that these dynamical

deformations increased the physical degradation of the glove surfaces and

decreased the strain energy.

Moreover, mechanical deformations with or without the additional contact of the

nTiO<sub>2</sub> solutions could affect the degree of crystallinity of the

elastomer materials. The colloidal solutions had a significant effect on the

swelling of both the nitrile rubber and latex glove materials. In conclusion,

the results show that great care must be taken in selecting protective gloves

for the handling of nanoparticles in colloidal solutions. It is already possible to

recommend the frequent replacement of disposable gloves when exposed to nTiO<sub>2</sub>in a liquid carrier.</p>
