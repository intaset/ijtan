<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
The multiple applications of gold nanorods (AuNRs) are most effective if the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can be simultaneously excited in all the involved AuNRs. This can be achieved in well aligned ensembles of AuNRs, obtained by stretching AuNR-polymer composite films, as a possible method.  One of the difficulties encountered in applying this method, is the thermal reshaping of the rods, which would change their optical properties. To mitigate this risk, while increasing the plastic deformability of the film, a polymer of high molecular weight mixed with a small amount of plasticizer was chosen as the composite matrix. The resulting composite films could be stretched up to seven times their initial length. To quantify the alignment of the rods, the average orientation angle was calculated based on scanning electron micrographs. An orientational order parameter of 0.92 was found, as compared to 1, which is the parameter value corresponding to perfect alignment. The anisotropy of the composite film was tested in linearly polarized light.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Metal nanoparticles (NPs) can have their
conduction electrons resonantly and coherently excited by the electric field of
an incident light beam that provides the exact energy necessary to atomic jump
to excited energy states. This phenomenon is known as localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR), [1, 2] as opposed to the propagating surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) [3, 4] of the conduction electrons at a flat metal-dielectric
interface. In optically anisotropic nanoparticles (NPs), such as nanorods (NRs),
of dimensions much smaller than the wavelength of the incident lightwave, two
modes of such resonant oscillation are possible. Depending on their direction
of oscillation, these modes can be longitudinal or perpendicular with respect to
the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the NRs. Out of the two LSPR modes, the
longitudinal one is adjustable over a larger range and is therefore most useful
and in demand. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Devices based on ensembles of misaligned
rods have averaged out optical properties and are thus characterized by
diminished sensitivity to polarized light and function less efficiently. On the
other side, devices containing fully aligned rods can reach maximal efficiencies
and for this reason, several methods of alignment of the rods have been studied
[5, 6, 7].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Rod alignment by film stretching is one
of these methods. It consists in embedding the AuNRs in a film of thermoplastic
polymer that is subsequently heated up to its softening temperature. By simultaneously
subjecting the film to tensile stress, a sufficiently large elongation can be
obtained. In this process, the nanorods in contact with the polymer chains get
entrained and reach a final orientational position parallel with the direction
of stretching. It results that the degree of alignment of the rods is directly proportional
to the stretch ratio of the film and therefore, the highest possible stretch ratio
was attempted in this work. This was achieved by slightly modifying the composition
of the composite matrix in order to improve its plastic deformability. A
stretching device was also designed in order to reduce the risk of film
fracture. Finally, the alignment of the AuNRs was assessed qualitatively by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified by calculating an average orientation
angle and an orientational order parameter.</p>

<H2>2.  Improving the Plastic Deformability</H2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The matrix of this type of composite film
is usually chosen to consist of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) because this polymer
can be drawn into thin and transparent films. This is due to its thermoplastic
properties, which makes that it softens when heated up to its glass transition
temperature T<sub>g</sub> (85°C) and flows under tensile stress. If PVA is cooled
back to room temperature, it regains its hardness in a reversible cycle. This
is possible because its molecules consist of many thousands of carbon atoms
bound together by single and strong covalent bonds, which form long linear
chains with rotational, bending and twisting flexibility in three dimensions [8].
Therefore, a well-stirred PVA aqueous solution with well dispersed AuNRs may
reach a highly entangled state of its chains. If the mixture is allowed to dry,
it will solidify in this state, forming a film. By heating up the film while
simultaneously applying a slowly increasing stretching force, the secondary
bonding forces between chains will be broken, allowing them to disentangle. Eventually,
the polymer chains will be straightened out with their axes oriented along the stretching
direction and the rods aligned parallelly to the stretch direction, as well. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Thus, matrix polymers of longer molecular
chains allow for higher film stretch ratios because the relative displacement
of the chains is possible along longer distances. However, the higher molecular
weights of such polymers also have higher glass transition temperature. But
heating up to this temperature is limited by the risk of thermal reshaping of
the rods with altered optical properties as a consequence [1, 9]. In order to
depress the softening temperature, a small amount of glycerol as plasticizer was
mixed in the polymer solution. The selection of glycerol was based on a study
[10] that found that it was one the plasticizers most compatible with PVA. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Subsequently, the transparency of the glycerol-PVA
films was tested in the visible-NIR range and it was found to have been well
maintained. This verification was necessary in order to insure that the optical
excitation of the embedded AuNRs would not be obstructed. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Finally, films with glycerol of 2% and 4%
mass percent concentration of PVA were tested and all could be stretched up to
a ratio of seven. However, because one undesired side effect of the plasticizer
is that the solidified film is less rigid, the optimal concentration of
glycerol was chosen such as to insure that the resulting film could maintain a
flat enough surface over a long period of time, after stretching.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Previous reports have indicated that a
stretch ratio of four to six would be sufficient for a perfect alignment [11]. In
order to insure the best possible alignment of AuNRs embedded in the composite
film, we aimed in this work for a stretch ratio of seven. </p>

<H2>3. Experimental</H2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Completely hydrolyzed PVA 146,000-186,000
MW, glycerol G9012 (&#8805; 99.50%) and gold nanorods 716812 (diam. × L 10 nm ×
38 nm +/- 10%) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.  A
volume of 11 ml of AuNR solution of concentration 35&#956;g/ml was used for
forming of a composite film.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A mass of 2.04 g PVA granules was
gradually mixed in 20 ml distilled and deionized water and slowly heated up to
about 95°C under stirring, until a clear and transparent 10% PVA solution was
obtained. After the solution cooled down to about 35°C, 32&#956;l glycerol (2%
of the PVA mass), was dropped into the PVA solution under stirring for an
additional 30 minutes. The solution was subsequently degassed. Finally, 3.0 g
of the above PVA-glycerol water solution was poured into a 50 ml beaker and 11
ml of the 35 &#956;g/ml AuNRs colloidal solution was added, well stirred and
sonicated for about 30 minutes. The AuNR-PVA solution was subsequently cast
into a 60 x 60 mm<sup>2</sup> flat mold and allowed to solidify for 48 hrs at
room temperature.  The film was afterwards kept in an oven at 40°C temperature
for 24 hrs to make sure it was completely dry. After having peeled it off, the
film was cut into 20 by 30 mm rectangular strips.  The strips were then clamped
into the stretching device and gradually stretched under heating at about 65°C.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Absorbance spectra were obtained using a
Perkin Lambda 650 spectrophotometer, in the visible - NIR region. Micrographs
were taken with the JEOL JSM840 scanning electron microscope.</p>

<H4> 3.1.   Morphological Characterization</H4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The average orientation angle of the rod
ensemble contained in a film strip was calculated based on dimensional data of
more than 160 rods collected from several SEM micrographs. We show one such
micrograph in the panel (a) of Figure 1. In order to define the orientational
angle of the rods, we show a few typical ones schematically depicted by golden rectangles, randomly oriented and zoomed-up in Figure 1.</p>


<figure>
<img src="003_files/image001.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 1. SEM micrograph
of a AuNR-PVA composite film showing rods more or less aligned along the stretch
direction s - s'. The inset drawing presents a detailed view of the rods and the
definition of the orientational angle &#966; of a typical rod with respect to the
direction s-s'.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The stretch ratio "R<sub>s</sub>" was defined
as the ratio: R<sub>s</sub> = L<sub>f </sub>/ L<sub>0</sub> where we denoted
the initial and final length, by L<sub>0</sub> and L<sub>f</sub>, respectively.
The film strip is stretched along the s - s' direction, represented by the
double headed arrow. The longitudinal elongation is associated with a transversal
contraction, caused by the Poisson effect. The orientation of the rods was measured
by the angle "&#966;", defined between the long axis of the rod and the stretch
direction s – s', as indicated in Figure 1.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The resulting sample mean was of &#966;<sub>avg</sub>
= 3.5&deg; with a standard deviation of &#963; = 11.05&deg;. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A two-dimensional orientational order
parameter defined as <span style='position:relative;'><img width=125
height=24 src="003_files/eqn1.gif"></span> [6, 12] was found with a
value of S = 0.92. This compares well to the value of S = 1, which is the value
of the parameter corresponding to the perfect alignment of the rods. </p>

<H4> 3.2.   Optical Characterization </H4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A plane
polarized lightwavewith the electric field parallel (E<b><sub>||</sub></b>) with the stretch
direction s'-s incidenton the composite film, is
strongly absorbed at the longitudinal wavelength and a minimal radiation energy
is allowed to pass through the film, as seen in panel (a) of Figure 2. If the
electric field of the lightwave is perpendicular E<sub>&#9524;</sub> to s
- s', then the lightwave energy is transmitted unabated through the film. Therefore,
the composite film has the same optical properties as a dichroic polarizer with
the transmission axis perpendicular to the stretch direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><img src="003_files/image002.png" class="img"></p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:10pt;">>Figure 2. (a) Normalized absorbance
spectra of uniaxially tretched AuNR-PVA film illuminated by plane polarized light
with the electric field parallel (E<sub>||</sub>) and perpendicular (E<sub>&#9524;</sub>) to the s' – s direction. (b) Linear trend
of the dichroic ratio dependence on the stretch ratio.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The above statement holds for the ideal
case of perfectly aligned AuNRs embedded in a composite film. In reality however,
a small absorbance peak can still be noticed located at the wavelength of the transverse
SPR, in panel (a), for light polarized parallel with the stretch direction. Similarly,
a small absorbance peak is seen to persist at the longitudinal SPR wavelength, for
light polarized perpendicular to the stretch direction. This demonstrates the
existence of a large enough number of AuNRs that could not be aligned during
the stretching process. These peaks would not exist in a perfectly aligned
ensemble of rods.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The polarization performance of the
composite film can be characterized by the dichroic ratio, defined as  the
ratio of the absorbance intensities for plane polarized light with the electric
field parallel and perpendicular to s'- s. The dependence of the dichroic ratio
on the stretch ratio is shown in panel (b) of Figure 2. The trend line fitted to
the experimental data suggests that the dichroic ratio depends linearly on the
stretch ratio.</p>

<H2>4. Conclusions</H2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In this work, a thermoplastic polymer (PVA) of high
molecular weight, mixed with a small amount of plasticizer (glycerol) was used as matrix material for
making AuNRs – composite films. Using a stretching device designed to avoid
factors promoting the fracture of the composite film, a stretch ratio of seven was possible. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The resulting alignment of the AuNRs was
quantified by calculating an average orientational angle of 3.5° and a two-dimensional orientational
order parameter of S = 0.92, which is 8% off the value of a perfectly aligned ensemble. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The AuNRs-PVA composite film was shown to
behave like a dichroic polarizer with the transmission axis perpendicular to
the stretch direction. A trendline fitted to the measured dichroic ratio suggests
a linear proportionality between its dichroic ratio and the stretch ratio.<</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The dichroic properties of the film can
be useful in applications for imaging, nonlinear optics, thermal therapy or
data encoding.</p>
