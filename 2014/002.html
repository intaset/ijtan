<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
  The
age of modern technology requires nano-size devices like batteries, capacitors,
and sensors. Currently the majority of nano-size devices are designed upon the
basis of artificially fabricated structures. The parameters of nano-size
structures can be determined and controlled by the number of external factors,
such as pressure and irradiation [1]. Earlier the possibility of creating such
low-dimensional nanostructures was predicted theoretically [2]. Salfi et al.
[3] have experimentally isolated and studied the effect of individual localized
electrons on carrier transport in InAs nanowire field-effect transistors, and
extracted the equivalent charge sensitivity. In the low carrier density regime,
the electrostatic potential produced by one electron created an insulating weak
link in an otherwise conducting nanowire field-effect transistor.    </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
  Within
the presented research project, we have analysed the prospective applications of
A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub> type semiconductors. We studied
the temperature dependences of electrical conductivity &#963;(T), the switching
effect, THz spectra and the permittivity &#949;(T) of A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
type semiconductors. Superionic conductivity was observed at temperatures above
300 K. We also studied the temperature dependences of &#963;(T) and
current-voltage characteristics subjected to various doses of &#947;-radiation
in both geometries of the experiment, along nanochains parallel to the
tetragonal axis of the crystal and perpendicular to these nanochains. The
results show that the physical parameters of nanochains can be controlled by
the choice of doses of &#947;-irradiation [4, 5].  In our opinion, the
possibility of re-ordering of nanochains in these crystals under the &#947;-ray
irradiation opens new prospects in the development of nano-size varistors,
electrochemical devices purposed for the transformation and accumulation of
energy, charges and information. </p>


<h2> 2. Growth of Monocrystals </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  We
have used the method of direct synthesis to synthesize A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
alloys. In synthesis experiments, the following elements were used: gallium
(&#1043;&#1051;-&#1042;4), indium (&#1048;&#1085;-000), thallium
(&#1058;&#1083;-000), sulfur elementary special purity
(&#1054;&#1057;&#1063;-16-5), and selenium of special purity
(&#1054;&#1057;&#1063;-19-5 &#1052;&#1056;&#1058;&#1059;6-09). The synthesis of
alloys, the differential thermal analysis (DTA), annealing processes, and
growth of monocrystals were carried out in quartz ampoules of various designs.
Previously the quartz ampoules were cleared by chromic mixture (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
+ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) or HF acid. Then the ampoules were annealed in a
furnace at 1030-1050 K over two hours. To work with easily oxidized
chalcogenides we developed a special container. The container includes an
ampoule of a conic form for the cleared material and the waste-collector having
a spherical form. The ampoule and the waste-collector are connected by a tube,
entering into the waste-collector. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  After
loading the initial components, the container was evacuated up to 1.33×10<sup>-2</sup>
Pa. After the synthesis was carried out, the container was placed in the unit
of vertical (or an inclined plane) zonal recrystallization (the top of a cone
of the ampoule entered into the unit). The container was rotated around its
axis at the speed of 3 - 4 rev/sec, and the melted end of the ingot was merged
in the waste-collector after each pass of the zonal; so the waste stayed in the
waste-container and did not get into the ampoule, when the container moved back.
After a certain number of passes of a zone, the ampoule was separated from the
waste-collector and placed in the vertical furnace of the directed
crystallization for the growing the monocrystals. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The
one-temperature method was used for the synthesis of TlSe, TlS, and alloys based
on TlSe, TlS; whereas for the synthesis of TlGaS<sub>2</sub>, TlGaSe<sub>2</sub>,
TlInS<sub>2</sub>, TlInSe<sub>2</sub>, InSe and alloys based on them – a
two-temperature method was used. Threefold compounds: TlGaS<sub>2</sub>, TlGaSe<sub>2</sub>,
TlInS<sub>2</sub>, TlInSe<sub>2</sub>, were also synthesized through the
interaction of the corresponding binary compounds on reactions: Tl<sub>2</sub>S
+ In<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> = 2TlInS<sub>2</sub>; TlS + InS = TlInS<sub>2</sub>;
TlSe + InSe = TlInSe<sub>2</sub>; TlSe + GaSe = TlGaSe<sub>2</sub> etc. These
syntheses were carried out using the one-temperature option. Cooling of an
ingot was carried out in the switched-off furnace. The experimental setup
consisted of the two-zonal furnace (providing an essential temperature
gradient); the voltage-controlling unit (autotransformers and 7.5
kW-stabilizators); the measurement unit, recording and controlling the
temperature (thermocouple, &#1055;&#1055;-63, &#1050;&#1057;&#1055;-4,
&#1042;&#1056;&#1058;-2); and the mechanism for moving the ampoule. Speed of
the motion of the ampoule   varied within (0.05-0.08)×10<sup>-6</sup> m/sec
depending on the parameters of monocrystals and the size of ampoules. The setup
was provided by a damper to reduce external mechanical vibrations.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> Stoichiometry
of the obtained compounds, the single phase characteristics, and homogeneity
was controlled by the X-ray diffraction analysis and derivatographic analysis.
The samples freshly cleaved along the crystallographic axis <i>c</i> were
prepared in a form of rectangles with a thickness of about 5 mm. The indium
contacts were formed on the surface of the cleavage of the samples; the ohmic
behaviour of these contacts was checked before each measurement.</p>

<h2>3. Material Characteristics </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
compounds exhibit an hexagonal structure made of layers of A and C atoms, which
form nanochains of A<sup>3,3+</sup>C<sup>6,2-</sup><sub>2</sub>, separated by a
layer of B atoms (see Figure  1). Electrical hoping-type conductivity occurs in
the metallic B layer, and thus this conductivity shows a strong anisotropy.</p>

<h4> 3.1. Superionic Conductivity </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
Unusual properties of superionic conductors
are interesting for the solving of fundamental problems of physics of condensed
matter and physical chemistry, and applications [6]. An important feature of
the superionic conductors is their anomalously high ionic conductivity, the
order of magnitude of which is close to that typical of melts and concentrated
solutions of strong electrolytic conductors. Consequently, superionic
conductors can be considered as substances with hybrid properties: the
conductivity of a liquid melt or solution and the mechanical strength of a
solid. Crystals with structural disorders hereinafter referred to as superionic
crystals, can be found in two radically different phases: at temperatures below
a critical temperature, they behave similarly to ordinary ionic crystals; at
temperatures above a critical temperature, they transfer to a special,
superionic state. The TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> semiconductor compound crystallizes in
the tetragonal space group and features a one-dimensional (1D) rodlike
structure. The electrical properties of the TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> compound were
studied in [7, 8]. The calculations of the energy band structure of TlGaTe<sub>2</sub>
showed that the top of the valence band is located at the high symmetry point T
at the surface of the Brillouin zone, while the bottom of the conduction band
is located at the line <i>D</i> [9]. The band gap obtained from performed
calculations was found to be equal to 0.86 eV.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In [10,
11] it is reported about the second-order phase transition at a temperature of
98.5K. Hanias and Anagnostopoulos [12], studying the current–voltage (<i>I–V</i>)
characteristics of a TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> crystal, detected the effect of
negative differential resistance and voltage oscillations in the region of
negative differential resistance. Our investigations [4, 5, 13-20] revealed
that TlGaTe<sub>2 </sub>chain crystals are subjected to phase transition in
superion state, and demonstrated giant dielectric relaxation, substantial
increase of dielectric permeability, and negative differential conductivity.
All of these effects are connected with the transition of systems in superion
state, when there is softening of Tl<sup>1+ </sup>sublattice (Figure 1), while
prolonged along tetragonal axis <b><i>c</i></b> of crystal Ga<sup>3+</sup>-Te<sup>2-</sup><sub>2</sub>
chains are the core of system. Univalent ions of thallium Tl<sup>1+ </sup>are
reason for the intensive relaxation processes observed in system. As opposed to
"classic" superion compounds, chain crystals are characterized by non-dispersion
of optical and acoustic modes [1]. In super ion state the translation is broken
only in one direction; so, the system passes to the superstructure state with the
origin of incommensurable phases.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Within
our resent studies, we investigated the dielectric and electrical properties of
TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> and TlInTe<sub>2</sub> at temperatures above 300 K. We
selected these compounds with the expectation that the crystalline structure these
compounds could be considered as promising materials with superionic
conductivity. The presence of a pseudogap in the density of states and the
existence of ultimately anisotropic (1D) and rodlike structure in the crystals
of this class makes it possible to expect specific features in electrical
conductivity; these features are related to the low-dimensional type of the
structure. We also studied the specific features of anisotropy of the electrical
conductivity of TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> and TlInTe<sub>2 </sub>crystals (both in the
linear and nonlinear regions of the <i>I–V</i> characteristics) and relation of
this anisotropy to both the structural features of the crystal and radiation
defects. We intended to analyze the conductivity of the crystal in terms of the
Mott and Pool–Frenkel models [21, 22].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  To
measure temperature dependences of permittivity and electrical conductivity of
the crystals, we fabricated capacitors with plates of the materials under
study, which served as a dielectric. Capacitor plates were made by deposition
of silver conducting paste on the plate's surface. Permittivity and electrical
conductivity were investigated with an E7-20 digital immitance-meter (Web-1) at
a frequency of 1 MHz in the temperature range 100-450 K. The amplitude of a
measuring field did not exceed 1 V/cm. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The
samples were studied by THz time-domain spectroscopy, which can record the
entire THz spectral response (0.1–3 THz) in a single measurement. Our classical
setup has been modified to focus most of the THz beam onto a small sample,
whose sizes are typically on the order 10–20 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h4> 3.2. THz Time-domain Spectroscopy </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Investigations
in the far infrared region could give additional information on the physics of A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
nanofibrous crystals. Here, the samples have been first studied by THz
time-domain spectroscopy, which permits recording the entire THz spectral
response (0.1–3 THz) in a single measurement. Our classical setup has been
modified to focus most of the THz beam onto a small sample, whose sizes are
typically on the order of 10–20 mm<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The
classical THz measurements were done in collaboration with IMEP-LAHC (University
of Savoy, France) in a homemade spectrometer. In classical THz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS), one records the temporal waveform impinging onto and
transmitted by the sample. Then a numerical Fourier transform of both signals
is performed. The ratio of the transmitted fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the
incident FFT spectra gives the transmission coefficient of the sample. If the
origin of time is preserved between the two requested measurements, then the
FFT gives both modulus and phase of the transmission coefficient. If the sample
is a slab with parallel sides, the index of refraction and the coefficient of
absorption could be accurately determined using an inverse electromagnetic
method. This method as well as derived ones are based on the linearization of
the phase at low frequencies, and thus the knowledge of the phase at a lower
frequency is necessary to determine the sample parameters at the next frequency
step. In materials exhibiting a high absorption band, the transmitted signal
within this band could be weaker than noise. In this case, the transmission
coefficient is almost zero in modulus, and its phase is unknown. The usual
solution to this problem is to perform THz-TDS in reflection. However, the
disadvantage of the reflection technique is its weak precision due to
difficulty in achieving an appropriate reference signal. This latter is
supplied by a metallic mirror located at the position of the sample, whose
coefficient of reflection is supposed to be 100 %. But even a small error in
position of the mirror, for example a few microns far from the actual position
of the sample, leads to dramatic errors, mostly concerning the refractive index
of the sample.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Due
to weak THz transmission in the absorption bands, the typical means of
determining the index of refraction and coefficient of absorption are not
valid. Thus, we used a method described in [4], combining measurements in both:
transmission and reflection. The basic idea is to derive a rough estimation of
the refractive index from reflection data, while both refractive index and
absorption coefficient are also calculated from transmission data. A
Kramers-Kronig calculation allows us to determine the refractive index from the
absorption spectrum measured in transmission. In the spectral regions of
transparency, both refractive indices determined from reflection and calculated
from transmission should be superimposed. To achieve superimposition, we add
the necessary missing 2<i>m</i>&pi; (where <i>m</i> is any integer) to the
phase values just after each high absorption region. We observe several
absorption peaks in the THz transmission spectrum of TlInSe<sub>2</sub> (Figure
 2). </p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Most
of them could be attributed to the excitation of phonons (A<sub>2u</sub> and B<sub>u</sub>)
[1, 23]. The absorption line at approximately 0.2 THz, seen only when the THz
field is aligned along the nanofibers, occurs at a frequency lower than the
lowest phonon one (A<sub>2u</sub>). Therefore, this frequency is probably
related to the libration oscillation of the <i><span style='position:relative;
top:5.0pt'><img width=59 height=24 src="002-IJTAN_files/image003.png"></span></i> nanofibers.
It is remarkable that the similar results were obtained for TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> [5];
namely it was observed that the absorption line at approximately the same
frequency (0.2 THz), seen only when the THz field was aligned along the <i><span
style='position:relative;top:5.0pt'><img width=59 height=24
src="002-IJTAN_files/image004.png"></span></i>nanofibers. </p>

<h4> 3.3. &#947;-irradiation Control </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In [4]
the conductivity in the ohmic region over the allowed band in the direction of
chains and perpendicularly to them is accomplished by thermally excited charge
carriers in TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> single crystals as temperature is lowered in the
range 300–90 K. As temperature is lowered, the charge transport is accomplished
by hops of charge carriers over localized states near the Fermi level; these
hops are more energetically favourable although they are more distant
spatially. As temperature is lowered further, the conventional hopping
conductivity is observed, in which case the mean length of a hop for charge
carriers amounts to a value on the order of the mean distance between
impurities and does not change as temperature varies. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  After
preliminary measurements of the values of &#963;<sub>||</sub> (T) and &#963;<sub>&#8869;</sub> (T), the samples were subjected to irradiation with &#947;-ray
photons from a standard Co<sup>60</sup> source. The radiation dose was
increased gradually for each of studied samples by sequential exposures to the
&#947;-ray radiation to the dose as high as 250 Mrad. Gamma rays passing
through a crystal mainly interact with an electronic subsystem. The cross
section of their interaction with atomic nuclei of a lattice is negligible in
comparison with the cross section of the interaction with electrons. The
interaction of gamma rays with the electronic subsystem is observed in the form
of three main processes: photoeffect, Compton's effect, and formation of
electron-positron couples. The impact of &#1057;&#1086;<sup>60</sup>
&#947;-irradiation  with energy of 1.17 and 1.33 Mev (in our experiments this
energy of &#947;-irradiation was used) mainly causes the creation of Compton
electrons, whereas the cross section of photoabsorption is less than a percent
of the cross section of Compton dispersion; and the formation of
electron-positron couples is negligible at these energies.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The
dose rate of &#947;-irradiation was 60 rad/sec. Consequently, the period of
radiation varied in the interval of 20-50 days for the doses 100-250 Mrad.
Heating of the samples during the irradiating was not observed. As temperature
is lowered to the value at which thermal activation of charge carriers to the
conduction band sets in, the dependence &#963;(T) becomes linear, which is the characteristic
of the band conductivity. Experimental results show that, after the &#947;-irradiation,
impurity energy levels caused by radiation defects appear in the band gap.
Thermal occupation of these levels occurs at temperatures lower than that of
unirradiated crystal; i.e., the temperature range of existence of thermally
activated conductivity is widened. For this temperature range, it is also
characteristic that, in this range, temperature related occupation of the trap
centres occurs; as a result, the localized charged impurities become neutral.</p>

<h2> 4. Theoretical Model </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Earlier,
we used the Mott approximation to calculate the values of the density of
localized states N<sub>f</sub>, the activation energy Ea, the hop lengths R,
the difference between the energy states &#916;E in the vicinity of the Fermi
level, and the concentrations of deep traps N<sub>t</sub> at various doses of
&#947;-irradiation for TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> crystals [5]. The analysis of the
dependence &#963; &#8733; E<sup>1/2</sup>
with the thermofield Pool–Frenkel effect taken into account shows that the
current in the nonlinear portion is caused by a small-magnitude field effect in
the course of measurements in the case of parallel and perpendicular directions
with respect to the tetragonal crystallographic axis of TlGaTe<sub>2</sub>. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  We
also determined the values of the concentration of ionized centres N<sub>f</sub>,
the free-path length &#955;, the Frenkel coefficients &#946;, and the shape of
the potential well in unirradiated TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> crystals and the crystals
irradiated with a dose of 250 Mrad. TlInTe<sub>2</sub> crystals were studied in
similar manner. The temperature dependences of electrical conductivity &#963;<sub>||
</sub>(T) and &#963;</span><sub>>&#8869;</sub>(T) of initial TlInTe<sub>2</sub> samples (curves <i>1</i>) and the
samples subjected to &#947;-ray irradiation (curves <i>2–5</i>) are shown in
Figs. 3 and 4.</p>

<figure>
<img src="002-IJTAN_files/image005.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 3. Temperature dependences of electrical conductivity &#963; &#8869;(<i>T</i>) in TlInTe<sub>2</sub> samples  before irradiation (curve <i>1</i>) and after &#947;-ray irradiation (curves <i>2–3</i>). The same dependences plotted in the Mott coordinates are shown in the inset.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  As
the radiation dose is increased to 100 Mrad, the conductivity decreases and
remains constant in the dose range of 100–200 Mrad; further increase in the
radiation dose brings about an increase in the conductivity. Charged defects
appearing as a result of irradiation with &#947;-ray photons play the dominant
role in these processes. The conductivity can be evaluated if we take into
account that the doses higher than 150–200 Mrad for these crystals apparently
represent only slight ionizing radiation and acts as an activating factor for
such processes as: migration of defects caused by interchain disorder and
transition of metastable states to stable states; i.e., radiation-stimulated
healing of structural defects is observed and leads to an increase in the electrical
conductivity of the crystal.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In
Table 1, we list the calculated values of the concentration of ionized centres <i>N<sub>f</sub></i>
and free path lengths &#955; of charge carriers; the calculations were
performed in the context of the Pool–Frenkel approximation [21]. As can be seen
from the table, irradiation of samples leads to pronounced anisotropy of the
parameters.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The
anisotropy of the free-path lengths &#955; of charge carriers is <span
style='position:relative;top:7.0pt'><img width=87 height=27
src="002-IJTAN_files/image006.png"></span>before irradiation and is <span
style='position:relative;top:7.0pt'><img width=87 height=27
src="002-IJTAN_files/image007.png"></span> after irradiation with a dose of 250
Mrad. The irradiation-induced increase of the free-path lengths parallel and
perpendicular to the chains is <span style='position:relative;top:7.0pt'><img
width=91 height=27 src="002-IJTAN_files/image008.png"></span>and <span
style='position:relative;top:5.0pt'><img width=87 height=24
src="002-IJTAN_files/image009.png"></span>respectively. The corresponding
ratios for concentrations of ionized centres are equal to <span
style='position:relative;top:8.0pt'><img width=80 height=25
src="002-IJTAN_files/image010.png"></span>and <span style='position:relative;
top:7.0pt'><img width=138 height=32 src="002-IJTAN_files/image011.png"></span>,
respectively. Thus, we may state that irradiation with a dose of 250 Mrad
causes the change of parameters of electronic subsystem.</p>

<h2> 5. Application Perspective </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> There are many articles
devoted to the investigation of superion state and possibility of creation of electrolytic
accumulators based on superion materials; memory cells, capacitors with large
capacity based on nanomaterials and mesoscopic structures, and low cost
varistors. Superion conductors are a special class of materials given much
attention. The unusual and paradoxical properties of these materials make them
interesting objects for studying the fundamental problems of solid state
physics as well as for prospective real-world application.</p>

<h4> 5. 1. Varistors with Controlled Parameters </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  It is
noteworthy that the described effect of the field-induced stepwise disordering
makes possible to implement the superionic state of A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2
</sub>crystals under convenient conditions, which offers interesting
opportunities for its application as varistors. The detailed analysis of
varistor effect in semiconductors is given in [5, 24]. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  As
stated above, irradiation with a dose of 250 Mrad causes re-ordering of
nanochains (nanoneedles) and, as a consequence, an increase in the free-path
length of charge carriers, which is observed in the nonlinear region of the <i>I–V</i>
characteristic. In our opinion, the potential re-ordering the nanochains in these
crystals under &#947;-ray irradiation offers new prospects in the design of nano-size
varistors with controlled parameters.</p>

<h4> 5.2. Solid Electrolytic Accumulators </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  
arried out experiments showed that the TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> compound
and its structural analogs: TlInSe<sub>2</sub>, TlInTe<sub>2</sub>, TlSe (Tl<sup>+1</sup>Tl<sup>+3</sup>Se<sub>2</sub>),
TlS (Tl<sup>+1</sup>Tl<sup>+3</sup>S<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>and TlTe (Tl<sup>+1</sup>Tl<sup>+3</sup>&#1058;e<sub>2</sub>)
compounds are subjected to phase transitions in superion state. Due to the nanofibrous
(nanochain) structure of crystals of this family, the disorder of Tl<sup>+</sup>
sublattice occurs, while, nanodimensial chains of In<sup>+3</sup>Se<sub>2</sub><sup>-2</sup>
- TlInSe<sub>2</sub>,<sup> </sup> In<sup>+3</sup>&#1058;e<sub>2</sub><sup>-2</sup>
- TlInTe<sub>2</sub>,<sup> </sup>Tl<sup>+3</sup>Se<sub>2</sub><sup>-2</sup> -
TlSe and Tl<sup>+3</sup>S<sub>2</sub><sup>-2</sup> - TlS make up topologically
disordered mesoscopic structures (Figure  5). Such mesoscopic systems possess a
number of unique properties, which are not observed in usual 3D structures,
namely: giant dielectric permeability [25], giant magnetic reluctances,
Fogel-Fulcher's law implementation, giant dielectric relaxation, terahertz
libration oscillations and other peculiarities. The peculiarities of the crystals of the TlGaTe<sub>2 </sub>family
in superion phase, namely, existence of nanofibrous topologically disordered
structure, allows to construct electrolytic accumulators with parameters exceed
in quality than known samples [26].</p>

<h4> 5.3. Capacitors </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In
nanoelectronics, due to toughening technological regulations and the reduction
of power supply (&lt; 0.5 V), the necessity of using micron scale high capacity
capacitors has drastically increased. Traditional capacitors do not have necessary
density of capacity, radiation, and temperature hardness. The analysis of
literature data [26-34] shows that development of nanoion supercapacitors based
on new superion conductors is necessary.</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 5. Solid Electrolytic Accumulators on base of TlGaTe<sub>2</sub> semiconductors.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> Expert
analysis of corporation growth in the industry of passive electron components
marks out supercapacitors as promising group of devices. Analyzing the global
market, the experts conclude that due to the use of nanotechnology the
technical characteristics of supercapacitors are rapidly improved, and the cost
per farad and stored energy is steadily decreased.  Since 1990s supercapacitors
have been widely used in electronics; more and more are needed to autonomous
sources with high energy density, capacityand power.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> Record high capacitive and frequency characteristics can be reached
by applying advanced superionic conductors (AdSIC) [26, 30-34]. In the firm ion
sublattice of these compounds there are structural canals on which the are
mobile ions of opposite sign. AdSIC have record high levels of ion-transport
characteristics – ion conductivity &#963;<sub>i</sub>=0.3 Om<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>
(RbAg<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub>), energy of activation &#1045;<sub>j</sub>=0/1
eV, which define the concentration of mobile ions n<sub>i</sub>=N<sub>i</sub>exp(E<sub>i</sub>/k<sub>B</sub>T).
Considering the above presented analysis we conclude that A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
type<sub> </sub>semiconductors are promising materials in the development of
high capacitance capacitors, due to the high capacitance in superion.</p>

<h2> 6. Conclusion </h2>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Within
the presented project, we have reviewed the physical characteristics of A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
type semiconductors and analyzed the application prospects of these crystals. Due
to their unique crystalline structure, these semiconductors can be used as
basis materials in the development of nano-size electronic devices, including
varistors, solid electrolytic accumulators, and supercapacitors.   </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">We have
shown that the conductivity mechanism of A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
type semiconductors can be affected by different doses of &#947;-irradiation.
This phenomenon shows A<sup>3</sup>B<sup>3</sup>C<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>
semiconductors to be promising material in the design of electronic devices
with controlled parameters.  </p>
