    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Institutions
of higher education throughout the United States must be prepared to provide
high-quality professional development for K-12 teachers that encourages them to
see connections between/among science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
via study of the core concepts and various applications of nanotechnology. The
development of an integrated science curriculum based on nanotechnology will
enable STEM teachers to inspire students to view science as immediately
relevant to their daily lives and, over time, worth pursuing as a major and a
career. This paper addresses some of the challenges associated with the need to
develop an effective method of institutionalizing interdisciplinary science
education through the use of nanotechnology to design, develop, and test a
multiple-level, inquiry-based educational model aligned with National Science
Education Standards.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 



<p class="body">Over the
course of the last two decades, the U.S. has failed to keep pace with its
global competitors in science and technology. President
Obama's "Plan for a Strong Middle Class and a Strong America," released in
conjunction with his 2013 State of the Union Address, emphasizes the need to
create a STEM Master Teacher Corps to consist of 10,000 of the finest science
and math teachers in the United States [1]. This portion of the
Administration's plan is based on recommendations by the President's Council of
Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to develop a critical mass of
educators who will collaborate with their peers to enhance STEM education in
the nation's public schools: "The most important factor in ensuring excellence
is great STEM teachers, with both deep content knowledge in STEM subjects and
mastery of pedagogical skills required to teach these subjects well" [2]. </p>

<p class="body">The
theory is sound in principle and noble in conceit: a relatively small cadre of
teachers with the necessary preparation and inspiration will return to their
communities to effect systemic change. Over the next decade, the ambition is
to prepare an additional 100,000 STEM teachers with the aid of the
philanthropic sector [3]. Nevertheless, given the lack of a budget to support
the system of rewards and recognition that the President has in mind, it may
not be possible to put this particular idea into practice. There is also the
enormous weight of the reality of STEM education in the K-12 system in the
United States to consider. While maintaining that well-qualified teachers are
the best indicator of student achievement, the Committee on Prospering in the
Global Economy of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century observed, "Many school children
are systematically discouraged from learning science and mathematics because of
their teachers' lack of preparation, or in some cases, because of their
teachers' disdain for science and mathematics" [4]. Indeed, out-of-field
teaching may be the single most important factor in the gradual decline in the
test scores of American youth. </p>

<p class="body">Teachers
without an undergraduate degree in science and without certification to teach
it are, in fact, the "norm" in many schools throughout the country: "In grades
9-12, the chance of being taught math by an out-of-field teacher [is] 31%, and
for physical science it is 63%" [5]. Furthermore, according to the National
Center for Education Statistics, only six states require that parents be
notified when their children are assigned an out-of-field teacher, and only
seven states place a "ban or cap on the number of out-of-field teachers" [6].
Under these circumstances, it may be more surprising that students in the U.S.
continue to score as well as they do than to read yet another report that they
have fallen behind in STEM disciplines by comparison with their peers
internationally. Against tremendous odds, roughly 6% of U.S. 15-year-olds yet
managed to distinguish themselves as measured by the Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2006 [7]. The average U.S. score in
science literacy had improved by 2009-when the nation's 15-year-olds ranked 24<sup>th</sup>
among their peers in all participating nations [8].</p>

<p class="body">In
order to ensure that more students have the opportunity to learn significant
STEM content, it will be necessary to educate-the-educators, especially as
there is strong evidence that the lack of qualified teachers actively deters
student interest and success [4]. If the STEM Master Teacher Corps is to
succeed, it will need the committed support of professional investigators and
qualified faculty members at the nation's institutions of higher education to
develop an integrated science curriculum and effective pedagogical strategies.</p>

<p class="body">Edward
T. Foley and Mark C. Hersam (2006) believe that extensive nanotechnology
education reform has the potential to "reverse the decay" in the "U.S. STEM
educational pipeline" and overcome the widening gap in the high-technology talent
pool between the United States and the remainder of the developed world [5]. A
decade ago, Mihail C. Roco (2003) suggested that, in order to facilitate the
integration of nanotechnology across the scientific curriculum, we must reverse
the typical learning "pyramid"-wherein an understanding of the "broad
connections" among the various STEM disciplines is gleaned only in the latter
stages of graduate school [9]. Nevertheless, such an undertaking will require
a radical re-thinking of the K-12 system-not only with respect to what is
taught, but how. Existing curricula and pedagogical strategies effectively
thwart students' ability to grasp "big ideas" because basic concepts in
biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics are taught piecemeal. </p>

<p class="body">How can
we enhance the ability of teachers to provide high-quality STEM education for
all students-and thereby assure that all students will have the opportunity to
learn significant STEM content? First, we must be willing to re-think and
re-structure the K-12 curriculum and associated pedagogical strategies: the
essential what and how of American public education. Second, we must admit
that "who" matters, too: only highly skilled teachers are capable of preparing
children to compete on a global basis and inspiring them to do so. If
institutions of higher education begin working in earnest with the public
school system to institutionalize interdisciplinary science education using the
core concepts of nanotechnology coupled with standards-driven, inquiry-based,
active learning strategies, we should be able to move toward a revitalized K-12
curriculum and make a significant difference in the quality of STEM education.</p>



<p class="subhead">1.1. Past Experience</p>

<p class="body">For those
who may be reluctant to believe that change of such a revolutionary nature is
possible, especially given the intransigency of the public school system in the
U.S., I offer this brief history of a course of study now deemed essential:
mathematics. Although Socrates had once used a lesson in geometry to prove the
existence of "inborn knowledge" [10], in the 1920s, the discipline of
mathematics was deemed suitable "for only a select few" by no less than William
Heard Kilpatrick-one of the most influential "progressive" educators in the
nation [11]. As a result, by the 1940s, U.S. Army recruits knew "so little
math that the army itself had to provide training in the arithmetic needed for
basic bookkeeping and gunnery" [11]. Perhaps calculus is still not regularly
offered in public schools throughout the U.S.; nonetheless, algebra and
geometry are by now firmly seated among the standards-thanks largely to the
persistence of mathematicians and high school teachers.</p>

<p class="body">Moreover,
a teacher-driven integrated science program (ISP) that has sustained itself for
more than two decades successfully added a unit on nanotechnology to the 9<sup>th</sup>-grade
curriculum in chemistry as early as 2000 [12]. This fascinating change in
course content emerged when the teachers realized that the ISP was working so
effectively that they could afford to drop "some foundational topics" in favor
of the new technology [12]. In their study, Larkin et al. (2008) attributed
the longevity and prosperity of this instance of curricular reform to teacher
leadership-the key ingredient in any attempt to transform the classroom [12]. </p>



<h4>2. Discussion</h4>

<p class="body">It
is well to keep in mind that the National Center for Learning and Teaching in
Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NCLTNSE) has been offering professional
development opportunities for public school teachers since 2005 [13]. These
two-day summer workshops have received impressive reviews from those in
attendance, yet there has been no sign of extensive improvement in the K-12
system. Furthermore, although dozens of high-school teachers participate in the
NCLTNSE's Materials World Modules Program, only four elementary/middle schools
are involved, nation-wide-and a mere eighteen colleges and universities are
listed as partners in developing modular instructional content to supplement
pre-college STEM curricula. </p>

<p class="body">In
2010, the National Science Foundation sponsored an International Benchmark
Workshop on K-12 Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE). In
assessing the status of efforts to introduce NSEE into K-12 education, the
authors of the "Workshop Report" concluded that progress "has been slow,
largely because the focus on teaching to science content standards, developed
independently by each state and often lagging the state-of-the-practice,
effectively precludes the use of NSE materials" [14]. Indeed, concerted
efforts have been made globally to develop educational modules that incorporate
nanoscale science and engineering at all grade levels, owing to the realization
that "nano-enabled technologies will be pervasive by the time students presently
in the K-12 grades enter the adult world" (Murday <i>et al</i>. 2010). Despite
the very great need for a well-educated and informed public, workshop
participants concluded that the identification of appropriate standards and the
development of teaching aids will prove ineffective unless teachers are
"comfortable with the materials" [14].</p>



<p class="subhead">2.1. Establishing Overall
Goals</p>

<p class="body">Obviously,
if the long-range purpose is to create a critical mass of committed teachers in
order to engage the instructional community in the development of a radically
new STEM curriculum, institutions of higher education must play an integral
role in the transformation-not only by better preparing future teachers but by
actively engaging those already in the field. In order to begin the process,
institutions of higher education should establish a set of specific goals in
support of the President's Plan, such as the following:</p>



<p class="body">Goal 1: To use
nanotechnology as a vehicle for enhancing the STEM content knowledge and
pedagogical skills of science teachers;</p>



<p class="body">Goal 2: To develop,
pilot, and refine a standards-based and inquiry-based curriculum module for
teachers that will show how nanoscale concepts can be used to facilitate
student learning of interdisciplinary core scientific concepts;</p>



<p class="body">Goal 3: To implement an
innovative model of mutual mentoring between higher-education faculty and
public school teachers in the area of nanotechnology; </p>



<p class="body">Goal 4: To expand outreach
programs for the broader K-12 community in partnership with the area museums
and other informal venues for science learning.</p>



<p class="subhead">2.2. Learning Progressions
for Teachers and Students</p>

<p class="body">In
2009, Corcoran, Mosher, and Rogat published a report based on panel discussions
held at the Center on Continuous Instructional Improvement (CCII) at Columbia
University examining the work that has been done, thus far, on learning
progressions in science, potential benefits of their application, and steps
necessary "to flesh out a map of progressions for K-12 science" [15]. As the
CCII Panel noted, one initial challenge concerns the identification of core
science concepts that will form the progression. Lynn Bryan <i>et al</i>.
(2007) have suggested that forming a consensus as to the "big ideas" to be
addressed may pose particular difficulties in nanoscale science owing to the fact
that it is a relatively new field of study [16]. </p>

<p class="body">Furthermore,
although learning progressions typically move from the concrete to the
abstract-the tangible to the invisible-nothing at the nanoscale is directly
observable without sophisticated instrumentation. Thus, modeling and training
in visualization via the required instrumentation will be required if teachers
and their students are to be able to "see" at the nanoscale-whereas few, if
any, public schools in the United States have access to this equipment.
Nevertheless, many institutions of higher education are in a position to
provide wider access to their instrumentation via the internet. Since electron
microscopes, Raman spectrometers, and the like can cost a university anywhere
from several hundred thousand to several million U.S. dollars, it behooves
these institutions to seek a greater return on their investments through the
general advancement of knowledge. Again, it is clear that the involvement of
institutions of higher education will be key to the success of any real
innovation, much less revitalization, of the science curriculum available to
U.S. students. </p>



<p class="subhead">2.3. Active Learning</p>

<p class="body">According
to Foley and Hersam, "The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has described
the necessary attributes of the engineer of 2020 as strong analytic skills,
practicing ingenuity, creativity, communication, a command of the principles of
business and management, leadership, high ethical standards, professionalism,
dynamism, agility, resilience, flexibility, and engaging in life long learning"
[5]. "Active learning"-widely used with considerable success in the
international business community in recent years-will be necessary to develop
the kind of leadership required for the transformation of the preK-12 educational
system in the United States. In broad terms, "active learning" entails
group-work designed to inspire inquiry to address real-world problems. </p>



<p class="subhead">2.4. Summer Teaching
Institutes</p>

<p class="body">With
the assistance of higher education faculty, teachers selected for the Master
Teacher Corps could initially participate and potentially lead professional
development workshops during the summer with a three-hour follow-up session to
be conducted two weeks afterward. The curriculum modules for such an
institute could include 1) an introduction to matters of scale with a hands-on
activity involving the creation of models designed to illustrate the principles
involved; 2) a discussion of size-dependent properties, e.g., color, surface
area, forces. (See Table 1 below.) By the end of the institute, teachers
should be able to develop lesson plans and exercises for students designed to
introduce them to nanotechnology for the strand "History and Nature of
Science"-a National Science Education Standards requirement they will readily
recognize as relevant to their teaching across all scientific disciplines.
Among many other possibilities, teachers could consider introducing
nanotechnology as the latest in a series of historic scientific breakthroughs.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.5. Shadowing</p>

<p class="body">Members
of the Master Teacher Corps could be paired, according to their interests, with
professional investigators at institutions of higher education to work on
specific hands-on projects during the summer and/or throughout the academic
year. In order to emphasize the widespread practical applications of
nanotechnology, participating teachers might find it particularly beneficial to
observe product samples from industry being visualized and characterized in the
laboratories of research institutions. Through the process of "shadowing," the
teachers will obviously learn additional science content, but they should also
be far better prepared to share their findings with students and others in
public venues: peer-to-peer presentations in their respective schools, science
fair competitions, and a variety of events sponsored by area museums.</p>



<p class="subhead">2.6.
Public Presentations</p>

<p class="body">It is the
mission of many museums nation-wide to ignite a passion for science, technology
and math in a dynamic, interactive environment. As part of a "capstone" project
resulting from the summer institute, public school teachers should be able to
demonstrate what they have learned for their students and other teachers, as well
as members of the general public. </p>



<p class="subhead">2.7.
Evaluation</p>

<p class="body">Both
formative and summative evaluations of the extent to which the goals have been
met must be conducted annually in order to garner private support and engage
the public as a whole. The data collected should come from instruments
designed to obtain qualitative and quantitative information. Evaluation
questions should include factors that hindered or facilitated implementation of
new curricular or pedagogical strategies, as well as the impact of the
initiative on teacher outcomes. Other evaluative activities could include
third-party observations conducted during the summer institutes and in the
public school classrooms; surveys to assess teacher content knowledge, as well
as motivation; focus group interviews during which teachers are asked to
reflect on their participation; and the sharing of program documentation. </p>



<h4>3. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">Despite
the challenges, it would be unconscionable to effectively deny the public
access to information that will be critical to making informed decisions
concerning its own welfare in the decades to come. Essentially, there must be
a way to circumvent-if not cut-the bureaucratic red tape and push toward an
integrated curriculum module that will facilitate the learning process for both
teachers and students. If we
provide high-quality professional development for high school science teachers
that encourages them to see connections between/among STEM disciplines via
study of the core concepts and various applications of nanotechnology, they
will be better prepared to inspire students to view science as immediately
relevant to their daily lives and, over time, worth pursuing as a major and a
career.</p>

<p class="body">Carl
Wiesman, former Associate Director for Science at the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, has urged educators to adopt techniques that
help students to "think like little scientists" [17]. Interestingly, this
should not be difficult as many experts in child development well know. The
realization that children inherently seek to understand the world about them by
observation, experimentation, and reasoning is at least as old as the work of
Jean Piaget (1896-1980) and has been widely promoted through the Montessori
system in the U.S. If this is indeed the case, it should be no more difficult
for people of any age to comprehend the core concepts of nanotechnology than it
is for them to master observations that are basic to science. For example,
first-graders watching a Gecko clinging to the glass sides of a terrarium or
observing water streaming from the leaves of a lotus are viewing phenomena
simultaneously relevant to nanoscale structure and the life sciences. Of
course, the degree to which individual students can understand the details of
causality-not to mention the mathematics that underpin the ability to predict
results at the nanoscale-will differ, at least partially, on the basis of their
intellectual maturity. </p>

<p class="body">The
real difficulties then lie in who will educate-the-educators and under what
circumstances will they be able to work together in order to develop a fully
fleshed-out integrated science curriculum appropriate for students at each
grade level. Courageous and dedicated high school science teachers have in
some cases done it on their own: as early as 2000, chemistry teachers at a high
school in Wisconsin working toward an integrated science curriculum dropped
some of their "foundational topics" and added a unit on nanotechnology [12].
The NSF has sponsored numerous workshops, conferences, and professional
development programs with these objectives in mind. The impact of a Master
Teacher Corps of 10,000 would certainly be felt, especially if the corps were
broad-based and not limited to teachers at schools that are already
high-performing. Much, however, will ultimately depend upon the commitment
that institutions of higher education are willing to make to K-12 education.
Given the decades of disgruntlement concerning the unpreparedness of entering
freshmen, it would seem that college/university administrators and faculty
would welcome the opportunity to make a difference; however, much time has been
wasted in "finger-pointing" and little attention has been paid to the
responsibility that colleges and universities have for ensuring the success of
K-12 teachers and, in turn, the quality of education they are able to offer
children. Here, again, there may be a note of hope to be found in the
President's 2013 State of the Union Address-this time in the form of a "stick"
as opposed to a "carrot." President Obama has called on Congress to "consider
value, affordability, and student outcomes in making determinations about which
colleges and universities receive access to federal student aid" [1]. </p>

<p class="body">A
great deal of research has been conducted, and the groundwork has been laid for
a revitalization of STEM teaching and learning using nanotechnology as the
basis for a new K-12 integrated science curriculum. The framework, hardware,
and expertise needed to disseminate information concerning the applications and
implications of nanotechnology are already in place at research institutions,
and these institutions must now give serious consideration to the long-term
value of a further investment in the intellectual advancement of public school
educators and, through them, the enhancement of awareness among the general
population. Nanotechnology could provide a unique context for helping teachers
develop both content knowledge and pedagogical skills. It is furthermore
crucial that the general public be well informed concerning increasingly
pervasive nano-enabled technologies that offer tremendous potential benefits
but may also have negative environmental and societal consequences. </p>

<p class="body">Who
will educate-the-educators? A Master Teacher Corps of 10,000 will not
suffice. Who will prepare the 100,000 new STEM teachers-regardless of the
source of funding? The responsibility clearly falls upon the institutions of
higher education whose obligation it is to provide the professional development
that current teachers-their <i>former</i> students-will need in order to equip
children in the K-12 public school system-their <i>future</i> students-with the
education they need in order to prosper. </p>
