<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
Nanotechnological devices for therapeutic applications are massively addressed to diseases prevalent in the developed world, particularly cancer, because of the wrong assumption (for both ethical and technical reasons) that nanomedicines are too expensive and thus they can not be applied to diseases of poverty. Here we have applied quantum dots to study at the cellular level the delivery of the contents of liposomes to erythrocytes infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and to macrophages infected by the leishmaniasis causative agent Leishmania infantum. A number of works have reported on the encapsulation in liposomes of drugs against both diseases as a strategy to increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease unspecific toxicity. Liposome-carried drugs end up inside Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (pRBCs) and in the phagolysosome system of Leishmania-infected macrophages but some knowledge gaps still obscure subcellular events related to these processes. As a proof of concept, we have used confocal fluorescence microscopy to follow the fate in pRBCs and infected macrophages of quantum dots encapsulated in liposomes, and of lysosomes, leishmaniasis and malaria parasites, nuclei, and phagosomes. Our data indicate that liposomes merge their lipid bilayers with pRBC plasma membranes but are engulfed by macrophages, where they fuse with lysosomes. Lysosomes have not been observed to join with phagosomes harboring single Leishmania parasites, whereas in phagosomes where the parasite has divided there is lysosome-specific fluorescence with a concomitant disappearance of lysosomes from the cytosol. In later stages, all the lysosome-specific label is found inside phagosomes whereas the phagosomal marker cadaverine strongly stains the macrophage nucleus, suggesting that Leishmania infection induces in its later stages nuclear degeneration and, possibly, apoptosis of the host cell. These results indicate that induction of macrophage apoptosis should be explored as a possible strategy used by Leishmania to prepare its egress.	</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>Leishmania</i> parasites have
two morphological forms, termed amastigotes and promastigotes, which are found
in the mammalian and sandfly hosts, respectively [1].
Amastigotes are largely intracellular stages that mainly live in the
phagolysosomal system of macrophages, the predominant host cell. Macrophages
are phagocytic and readily engulf amastigotes, followed by phagosome-lysosome
fusion. This microbial defence mechanism is lethal to most foreign organisms,
as it results in exposure to an acidic pH of 4.5 to 5.5 and attack by a battery
of lysosomal enzymes. However, <i>Leishmania</i> can survive this experience,
and indeed thrives in this environment [2].
Parasites within the phagolysosome grow and divide, such that an individual
macrophage may eventually contain many tens of amastigotes. There is no
specific escape mechanism known, and it is assumed that in most cases the host
cell simply ruptures when it cannot accommodate any more parasites, which are
then taken up by further macrophages.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The treatment of leishmaniasis
will depend on its clinical form, but it is based mainly on pentavalent
antimonial compounds. Amphotericin B and its modern liposomal formulation have
an important role in current treatment schedules, although high costs limit
their use in most endemic countries. New drugs such as miltefosine, the first
orally administered treatment against <i>Leishmania</i>, represent attractive
alternatives that have been evaluated in several clinical trials [3]. The hidden location of amastigotes inside the macrophage's
phagolysosomes is responsible for impairing the accession of therapeutic drugs,
rendering these poorly selective, or forcing their administration in repeated
and high doses by parenteral routes [4, 5]. These facts contribute to the high toxicity and in most cases to the
limited compliance and efficacy of current conventional medication used against
all the clinical forms [6, 7, 8]. Drug delivery systems should allow avoiding the adverse
effects caused by problematic routes of administration as well as enhancing the
antileishmanial activity and reducing the toxicity of the medication [9].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Liposomes, when administered <i>in
vivo</i> by a variety of routes, rapidly accumulate in the mononuclear
phagocyte system, a phenomenon that can be used to target drugs for the
treatment of intracellular parasites that reside in macrophages, such as <i>Leishmania</i>
 [10]. A number of studies have been conducted to
exploit liposomes as drug vehicles for the treatment of leishmaniasis [11-18], but data about the subcellular fate of liposome-encapsulated drugs are
scarce.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Current administration
methods of antimalarial drugs deliver the free compound in the blood stream,
where it can be unspecifically taken up by all cells, and not only by <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected
red blood cells (pRBCs). Nanosized carriers have been receiving special
attention with the aim of minimizing the side effects of malaria therapy by
increasing drug bioavailability and selectivity [19]. To follow the delivery of liposomal contents into
pRBCs and <i>Leishmania</i>-infected macrophages we have used luminescent
semiconductor nanocrystals termed quantum dots [20].
Quantum dots (QDs) provide unique intrinsic photophysical properties for
potential medical, diagnostic and basic research applications, among them high
quantum yields and high molar extinction coefficients along with exceptional
resistance to both chemical and photodegradation. QD encapsulation into
liposomes can be studied by electron microscopy and their release to pRBCs and
macrophages can be conveniently followed by fluorescence microscopy over a wide
concentration range, a versatility that can not be matched by small
fluorochromes.</p>


<h2> 2. Materials and Methods </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Except where otherwise indicated,
all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).</p>

<h4> 2.1. Liposome Formation </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Liposomes were prepared by the
lipid film hydration method [21]. Different lipid
combinations were tested in order to establish a liposomal formulation with low
hemolytic activity and low general cytotoxicity. Lipids (1,2-dioleoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine,
DOPC; 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<i>sn</i>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyramide],
MPB-PE; Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL, USA; both &#8805; 99% purity
according to thin layer chromatography analysis) were dissolved in
chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) in a round-bottomed flask. Organic solvents were
removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure at 37 °C to yield a thin lipid film on the walls of the flask, and remaining solvent traces were
eliminated by drying under N<sub>2</sub> flow for 30 min. Films were left
overnight in a desiccator to ensure the complete removal of chloroform. The dry
lipids were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (137 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37 °C to obtain a concentration of 10 mM and multilamellar liposomes were formed by 3 cycles of
constant vortexing followed by bath sonication for 4 min each. Multilamellar
liposomes were downsized to form uni- or oligolamellar vesicles by extrusion
through 200-nm polycarbonate membranes (Poretics, Livermore, CA, USA) in an
extruder device (LiposoFast; Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). Liposome size was
determined by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer NanoZS90 (Malvern Ltd,
Malvern, UK). Liposomes encapsulating 120 nM 655 ITK<sup>™</sup> carboxyl
quantum dots (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) were prepared by dissolving QDs
in the hydration buffer. At the concentrations used in macrophage and pRBC
cultures, QDs were neither cytotoxic nor hemolytic. Immunoliposomes bearing on
their surfaces specific antibodies against pRBCs were prepared following
established protocols [22]. Liposomes were pelleted by
ultracentrifugation (100,000× <i>g</i>, 2×, 45 min, 4 °C), and finally resuspended in 10 volumes of PBS and kept at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks before adding them to cultures.</p>

<h4> 2.2. Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM) </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For cryo-TEM
analysis of the preparations of liposomes loaded with quantum dots, a thin
aqueous film was formed by placing a 5-µl sample drop of the liposome suspension on a glow-discharged holey
carbon grid and then blotting the grid against filter paper. The resulting thin
sample films spanning the grid holes were vitrified by plunging the grid (kept
at 100% humidity and room temperature) into ethane, which was maintained at its
melting point with liquid nitrogen, using a Vitrobot (FEI Company, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands). The vitreous films were transferred to a Tecnai F20 TEM (FEI
Company)using a Gatan cryotransfer (Gatan,
Pleasanton, CA), and the samples were observed in a low dose mode. Images were
acquired at 200 kV at a
temperature between –170 and –175 °C and low-dose imaging conditions below 20 e<sup>–</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>,
with a 4096×4096 pixel CCD Eagle camera (FEI Company).</p>

<h4>2.3. Assay on Intracellular <i>Leishmania infantum</i> Amastigotes</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Promastigotes<i>
</i>of the MCAN/ES/92/BCN503<i> L. infantum</i> strain were cultured at 26 °C in
Schneider's medium, pH 7.0, supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated foetal
bovine serum (FBS; SLI Barcelona Antibody), 25 &#956;g/ml gentamycin
and 1% penicillin (100 U/ml)–streptomycin (100 &#956;g/ml),
and were collected during stationary phase at a concentration of 1×10<sup>8</sup>
cells/ml. Subsequently, the parasites were labelled with 2.5 µg/ml carboxyfluorescein
diacetate N-succinimidyl esther (CFSE) solution in PBS, for 5 min at 26 °C.
Labelling was quenched with an equal volume of supplemented Schneider's culture
medium. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained after stimulation of female Swiss
mice with 3 ml of 3% sodium thioglycolate. After 48 h, 4 ml of physiological
serum at 4 °C was injected intraperitoneally, and after 15 min peritoneal fluid
was collected and centrifuged. Suspensions of 5×10<sup>4 </sup>cells/ml in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100
U/ml)–streptomycin (100 &#956;g/ml) solution were prepared
and 0.3 ml was seeded in a LabTek 8 chamber slide system (Nalge Nunc
International, Rochester, NY, USA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After incubation the medium was removed and 0.3 ml
of late stationary phase CFSE-stained promastigotes was added at
a concentration of 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. After 4 h of incubation at
35 °C, extracellular parasites were removed by washing with sterile PBS, and
0.2 ml of liposome-encapsulated QD suspension in PBS was mixed with 0.2 ml of
RPMI-1640 medium and the resulting 0.4 ml (containing 60 nM QDs) was added to
each well and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere for the
times indicated. The cells were subsequently washed and slides were prepared for confocal fluorescence
microscopy.</p>

<h4> 2.4. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Cell Culture </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The
<i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 strain was grown <i>in vitro</i> in group B human RBCs
using previously described conditions [23]. Treatment of
cultures with QD-containing liposomes was done following established protocols [22].</p>

<h4> 2.5. Cytotoxicity and Hemolysis Assays </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For cytotoxicity assays, serial dilutions of QD solution in RPMI-1640 medium were added to 100 μl of the murine monocyte-macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 cultured in 96-well plates (Costar Corning Inc.) at a concentration of 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, 10 &#956;l of 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene
disulfonate labelling reagent (WST-1; Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was added to each
well, and the plate was incubated in the same conditions for 4 h. After
thoroughly mixing for 1 min on a shaker, the absorbance of the samples was
measured at 450 nm using a Titerek Multiskan Plus MK II 314 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc.). WST-1 in the absence of cells was used as blank and samples
were prepared in triplicate for each experiment. Hemolysis assays were
performed as described elsewhere [22].</p>

<h4> 2.6. Confocal Microscopy </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Macrophage and <i>Leishmania</i>
nuclei were stained for 10 min with either 1 &#956;g/ml Hoechst 33342
(Molecular Probes) or 1 &#956;M TOPRO-3 (Invitrogen), lysosomes for 30 min with
50 nM Lyso Tracker Red (DND-99; Molecular Probes), and phagosomes for 10 min with
0.05 nM mono dansyl cadaverine. RBC membranes, <i>Plasmodium</i> nuclei, and
secondary antibodies were stained following established protocols [22]. After the corresponding incubations and PBS washing steps, the
samples were fixed for 20 min with 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and finally mounted with Prolong Gold (Invitrogen) following
standard protocols. Samples were imaged with a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning
confocal microscope equipped with an acoustic optical beam splitter, a DMI6000
inverted microscope, blue diode (405 nm), Ar (458/476/488/496/514 nm), diode
pumped solid state (561 nm), and HeNe (594/633 nm) lasers, and APO 63× oil (NA 1.4) or glycerol (NA 1.3) immersion
objective lenses. Hoechst 33342 (or 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole, DAPI), quantum
dot, CFSE (or fluorescein-labelled secondary antibody), DND-99 (or
WGA-rhodamine), TOPRO-3, and mono dansyl cadaverine images were acquired
sequentially using 405, 458, 488, 561, 633 and 405 nm laser lines, and emission
detection ranges 415–480, 643–735, 500–545, 571–630, 643–735 and 500–545 nm,
respectively, with the confocal pinhole set at 1 Airy units. Images were acquired
at 400 Hz in a 512×512 pixels format, 8× zoom, and pixel size of 60×60 nm.</p>

<h2> 3. Results </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">According to cryo-TEM
analysis, 655 ITK<sup>™</sup> carboxyl QD-loaded liposomes contained variable
numbers of QDs that were either associated to the membrane or free in the
liposomal lumen (Figure 1). Under the preparation conditions used in this work,
approximately half of the liposomes contained at least one QD.

QDs were observed to be ca. 5×10
nm rods, in agreement with the maker's information (Web-1). They have a CdSe
core encapsulated in a crystalline shell of ZnS and an external amphiphilic
polymer coating to prevent formation of free Cd, and are widely used in live-cell
<i>in vitro</i> assays (Web-1).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">QDs have been explored
as an aid to characterize the targeting of immunoliposomes designed for the
delivery of antimalarial drugs to pRBCs. A prototype nanovector was constructed
consisting of 120 nM 655 ITK<sup>™</sup> carboxyl QDs encapsulated in
immunoliposomes with the formulation DOPC:cholesterol:MPB-PE 77.5:20:2.5, which
carried a specific antibody against pRBCs. QD-loaded immunoliposomes were added
to 3% hematocrit living cultures of the <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 strain at a
concentration in the dish of 1 mM lipid and 60 nM QD to analyze whether they
exhibited the expected targeting towards pRBCs. At this concentration
QD-containing liposomes did not induce detectable hemolysis. After incubating
for 90 min with gentle stirring the samples were processed for detection by
confocal fluorescence microscopy of cell membranes, QDs, targeting antibody,
and parasite nuclei. The results obtained showed an invariable colocalization
of the four signals only in late form-containing pRBCs, but not in the early
forms also called ring stages (Figure 2). QD signal in pRBCs was scattered
throughout the cell, without evidence of containment inside any particular
organelles or vesicular structures. No intracellular QD fluorescence was
observed when free 60 nM QDs were added to cultures (data not shown).</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In a preliminary approach to the
application of QD-loaded liposomes to leishmaniasis research, we analyzed by
fluorescence confocal microscopy the subcellular localization of QDs
encapsulated in DOPC:cholesterol 80:20 liposomes that were delivered to <i>Leishmania</i>-infected
macrophages. At their final concentration present in the cultures (60 nM), QDs
did not induce detectable cytotoxicity in macrophage assays (Figure 3).</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:10pt;">Figure 3. Cell viability assay of the effect of QDs on macrophages.</p>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">One hour after the addition of
the liposome suspension to a macrophage culture the QD fluorescence could be
already observed inside the cells as whole internalized liposomes fused with
lysosomes (Figure 4A). Figure 1B shows a macrophage 27 h post-infection with
three phagosomes (arrowheads), or parasitophorous vacuoles, in whose interior
the green fluorescence corresponding to the prior labelling of <i>Leishmania</i>
parasites with CFSE can be observed. The punctate pink fluorescence corresponds
to lysosomes labelled with the lysosome tracker DND-99. Colocalization analysis
of QDs and lysosomes confirmed that internalized liposomes fuse with lysosomes
(Figure 4C). Because of the lack of significant QD fluorescence not
colocalizing with lysosomes, we conclude that any fraction of QDs not
encapsulated in liposomes will also end up in the lysosome system, in agreement
with previous data [24]. The arrowhead in the
<i>merge</i> panel shows the parasitophorous vacuole, which does not contain
QDs. In the early stages of infection, up to 27 h, single parasites could be
observed inside the phagosome, and numerous lysosomes were found scattered

throughout the macrophage cytosol (Figure 4D). In Figure 4E is shown a
macrophage in a more advanced stage of infection containing two vacuoles, one
probably with a single parasite (arrowhead), and a second vacuole where <i>Leishmania</i>
had replicated, as suggested by lighter CFSE staining of the individual amastigotes
(arrow). Here, lysosomes were essentially absent from the cytosol and their
specific fluorescence was strongly localized inside the vacuole where <i>Leishmania</i>
had already divided, but not in the vacuole containing only one parasite. In
later stages, 52 h post-infection, we have observed strong staining of the
macrophage nucleus with mono dansyl-cadaverine (Figure 4F), a phagosome marker.
As in Figure 4C, also corresponding to a sample 52 h post-infection, the macrophage nucleus appeared swollen.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Likely, the progression of
infection was at an earlier stage in panel C, as suggested by abundant
lysosomes still present in the cytosol.</p>

<h2> 4. Discussion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In leishmaniasis, the
interactions of phagosomes harboring <i>L. donovani</i> promastigotes with late
endosomes and lysosomes are inhibited until the promastigote has fully
differentiated into an amastigote [25].
Lipophosphoglycan, the major surface glycoconjugate on <i>L. donovani</i>
promastigotes, is transferred from the parasite to the host macrophage membrane
during phagocytosis and induces periphagosomal actin accumulation correlating
with an inhibition of phagosomal maturation [26]. The
resulting increased membrane rigidity has been shown to reduce phago-lysosomal
fusion [27], suggesting that alteration of the biophysical
properties of membranes may be the reason for the reduced ability of the host
macrophages to accomplish phagosomal maturation upon infection.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In the
nuclei of macrophages that had been infected by <i>L. infantum</i> ca. 52 h
earlier, we have observed signs compatible with apoptosis, such as cadaverine-positive labelling and nuclear swelling. Because
these symptoms of nuclear degeneration are coincident with the disappearance of
lysosomes from the cytosol, it is likely that the phagosome-lysosome fusion
triggers alterations in the macrophage nucleus. This in turn suggests that a
signal should travel from the phagosome to the nucleus to start the process.
Since we have observed that phago-lysosomal fusion proceeds only after intraphagosomal
replication of <i>L. infantum</i>, some event related to the
promastigote-amastigote transition might be ultimately responsible for the
release of the predicted chemical signal(s). Although it has been reported that
<i>Leishmania</i> infection protects macrophages from exogenously-induced apoptosis, the corresponding data were obtained 16 h [28] and 24 h post-infection [29]. Our results suggest that at longer times the parasite might be inducing macrophage apoptosis, perhaps as a strategy to prepare its egress. The quantitative incorporation of liposomal contents (QDs) into cytosolic lysosomes and the subsequent phagosome-lysosome fusion, show that lysosomes can target liposomal anti-<i>Leishmania</i> drugs towards the parasite-containing phagosomes. The data presented here indicate that liposome-lysosome fusion is then a prior event to phagolysosome formation and this knowledge can be of use for the design of new targeted drug delivery strategies against leishmaniasis.
In the case of malaria,</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In the case of
malaria, the homogeneous distribution inside pRBCs of QDs delivered within
liposomes suggests that the liposomal contents enter the cell through a process
of fusion of the liposome lipid bilayer with the cell plasma membrane. RBCs
have poor endocytic processes, and for this reason liposomes docked by specific
antibodies can be an efficient system to deliver drugs into the cell by such
membrane fusion process [30], which occurs on a time scale
of milliseconds [31].The
remarkable capacity of liposomes to inject their contents into pRBCs presumably
has its basis on alterations of the pRBC plasma membrane rendering it less
elastic [32], and thus limiting the rebounding of colliding
liposomes. The resulting slightly longer interactions, a phenomenon exacerbated
if targeting molecules are present, likely allow enough time for the physical
phenomenon of lipid bilayer fusion to occur.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Finally, since QDs have a size
similar to that of a large protein, the data presented here indicate that
immunoliposomes can be a valid system for the delivery to pRBCs of possible
future macromolecular antimalarial drugs.</p>

<h2> 5. Conclusion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Liposomes
encapsulating QDs have provided valuable information regarding the subcellular
localization of their contents once target cells are reached, i.e. the <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected
erythrocyte and the <i>Leishmania</i>-parasitized macrophage (Figure 5). This
knowledge can be of use for the design of new therapies specifically targeting
particular molecular components of the cell. The above results highlight the potential
of nanomedicine for the treatment of infectious diseases of poverty, and
advocate for a determined entry of nanotechnology in the fight against
widespread pathologies in low per capita income regions.</p>
