<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 

<p class="body">
  The size and shape of
nanoparticles are important parameters for technical applications. Hence, the
size and shape are carefully controlled in the preparation of nanoparticles.
The Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) or the Scanning Electron Microscope
(SEM) is used for evaluating the size and shape of nanoparticles. In the process
of preparing these nanoparticles, we have a strong demand for the information
of the size and shape of the particles at the same time. TEM and SEM are
powerful tools, but preparing a sample takes time.</p>

<p class="body">
  Conversely, optical scattering
methods such as Rayleigh-Mie scattering are useful methods for measuring the
size of nanoparticle. In general, if the diameter of scattering particle<i> d</i>
is much smaller than the wavelength of incident light l and if <i>d</i> is larger than l, the former is Rayleigh
and the latter is Mie scattering, respectively. Since there is no noticeable
boundary, in this paper we use the word Rayleigh-Mie scattering. In
Rayleigh-Mie scattering, the scattered signal intensity strongly depends on the
particle size as a function of the scattering angle [1]. The size of the
particle can be estimated from the analysis of the angular dependent signal.
Theoretical analysis of the light scattering from spherical and the
non-spherical nanoparticle has been performed for a long time. Several
experiments relating for spherical particles have also been performed. But when
non-spherical particles, such as needle and ellipsoidal nanoparticles, are
dispersed in solution, we obtain an
only mean diameter of rotating particle because of the free rotation of
non-spherical particle. Thus the experiments and analysis of non-spherical
particle are complicated. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the shape of
non-spherical nanoparticles dispersed in solution with the ordinary
Rayleigh-Mie scattering method.</p>

<p class="body">
  We have investigated the
short-time measurement method of the size and shape of non-spherical
nanoparticles by using the Rayleigh-Mie scattering. Our goal is to develop a
real time measurement system for checking the size and shape during the preparation
of nanoparticles. It is needed for the Rayleigh-Mie scattering that the axis of
nanoparticle which we want to measure is held to the direction of the
polarization of incident beam. In order to hold the axis of non-spherical
nanoparticle, we try to use the rotation and migration of nanoparticle by the
electric field. Dielectric non-spherical particles rotate due to electric
torque [2]. It must be also pulled by the Coulomb force from the electrodes.
These two phenomena can create a stream of nanoparticles. In this stream, the
particles must be aligned. In this paper, we report the alignment of needle
nanoparticles because of migration due to an electric field. By developing a
cell to align (control) the orientation of non-spherical particle in solution,
we made it possible to measure the size and shape of non-spherical
nanoparticles in a short-time by using the Rayleigh-Mie scattering.</p>

<h4> 2. Experiment </h4>


<p class="body">
  The wavelength of the excitation
laser was 532 nm, and its polarization ratio was over 100:1. The polarization
was in a direction perpendicular to the observation plane. The scattering angle
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;;position:relative;
'><img width=9 height=19 src="IJTAN%20-%20003_files/image001.png"></span> was
defined as the angle between the propagation directions of the scattering light
and the incident beam. The scattering light was observed for the angular region
20&deg;-60&deg; for
present system. The optical cell had an anti-reflection coating for the
wavelength 532 nm. We observed the polarization direction of the scattering
light perpendicular to the polarization of the incident beam to eliminate any
stray light. As the result of having tried various shape electrodes, only the
shape as shown in Figure 1a successfully aligned the non-spherical
nanoparticle. The direction of the stream to the polarization of incident beam
is changed by turning the electrode. We applied electric field of 2.4×10<sup>5</sup>
V/m between electrodes. The particles are expected to flow in the direction of
the gray arrow shown in Figs. 1b and c. In this experimental configuration, we
can observe the information about the length of particle along the polarization
direction of the incident beam. If the particles are aligned with the stream,
the excitation geometry of Figure 1b could obtain the information of the short
axis, while the information of the long axis can be obtained from the geometry
of Figure 1c.</p>

<p class="body">
The sample used for experiment
was TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle of needle-like shape. The SEM image of sample
was shown in Figure 2. It was estimated that the length of long axis was around
400­­–500 nm, while the length of short axis was around 50 nm respectively. </p>

<h4> 3. Results and Discussion </h4>

<p class="body">
  Experimental results for the
electrode geometries in Figure 1b and c are shown in Figure 3(a) and (b)
respectively. The signal intensities are normalized to the intensity of the
signal without electric field when the scattering angle is 40&deg;.</p>

<p class="body">
  For the geometry in Figure 1b,
the signal intensity monotonically decreases as increasing the scattering angle
as shown in Figure 3(a). When the electric field is applied, the signal
intensity becomes smaller over the scattering angle than those without electric
field. Conversely, for the geometry of Figure 1c, the signal intensity
increases by the applied electric field as shown in Figure 3(b). In addition,
the local maximum appears at around 40&deg;.</p>

Dotted line in (a) and dashed line in (b) are the guide to the eyes for the case that electric field is applied.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">
In order to analyze the
experimental results, we used the theoretical calculation program, "Mie Plot",
which gives the angular dependence of the scattering intensity due to a fine particle with spherical shape. This
program has been developed based on the algorithms of Bohren and Huffman [3, 4,
and 5]. The parameters needed in the calculation are the wavelength of
excitation light, the refractive indexes of the material and the surrounded
medium, and the particle diameter. As mentioned above, the scattering intensity
depends on the particle diameter in the polarization direction of incident beam
for Rayleigh-Mie scattering. The non-spherical nanoparticle such as needle-like
particle has long and short axes. Thus in present study, we assume that the
light scattering when the polarization direction is fix to the direction of
long (short) axis of a non-spherical particle corresponds to that from a
spherical particle which has the diameter equal to the length of long (short)
axis. The theoretical calculation using Mie Plot was performed by changing the
diameter. The values of parameters for calculation except for diameter are as
follows.</p>


<p class="body">   Refractive index of TiO<sub>2</sub>: 2.6</p>

<p class="body">   Refractive index of water: 1.33</p>

<p class="body">   Wavelength of excitation light: 532 nm</p>

<figcaption>
Figure 4.  Calculation results of the signal intensities as a function of scattering angle for diameter ranging 150 nm to 190nm.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">
  First, the experimental result shown
in Figure 3(a) is analyzed. Without application of the electric field, the
nanoparticles move freely in solution. Thus, the effective length of free
rotational non-spherical particle is needed in order to evaluate the results of
the light scattering measurement. From SEM image shown in Figure 2, roughly
estimated effective length is around 180 nm. (The detailed of the estimation is
mentioned later.) Thus the angular dependence of the scattering intensity for
the diameter from 150 nm to 190 nm was calculated as shown in Figure 4. Since
the result at 20&deg; may
be contaminated by excitation light, the calculation is performed between from
25&deg; to 65&deg;.
It is noticed that the slope of each line changes as changing the diameter. One
can find that the slope of experimental data is in good agreement with
theoretical calculation when the diameter of nanoparticle is 160 nm.</p>

<p class="body">
When the electric field is
applied, it is expected that the length of short axis can be measured from
light scattering. Since the length of short axis is also roughly estimated to
50 nm from the SEM image, the angular dependence of the scattering intensity
for the diameter from 30 nm to 70 nm is calculated. Because of Rayleigh
scattering region, the change of the slope is too small to compare the results
of experimental data and theoretical calculation in the present experimental
system. Therefore, we use 50 nm as the length of short axis from the SEM image.
</p>

<p class="body">
  The results of calculations,
where that the diameters are set to 160 nm (electric field off) and 50 nm
(electric field on) are shown in Figure 5(a). Assuming that the distribution of
the diameter of nanoparticles used in the experiments, the calculation denoted
as 160 nm is an average of scattering intensities for the diameter ranging
155–165 nm. Similarly, for the calculation as 50 nm is an average of the signal
range 45–55 nm. The behavior of the angular dependence of the scattering
intensity obtained in the experiment shows qualitatively agree with that of
theoretical calculation for the case of 160nm. However, it is noticed that the
relative intensity of each signal was different when compared with the results
of Figure 3(a) and Figure 5(a). This difference could be caused by the partial
alignment of nanoparticles in solution. Some of the nanoparticles are aligned
by the application of electric field, while some others are not. Since both,
the aligned particles and the non-aligned particles, contribute to the signal,
we introduce the factor of alignment ratio <span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol'>h</span> for the improvement of the theoretical
calculation. Considering the ratio <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
Symbol'>h</span> of alignment, the effective signal intensity<i> I</i><sub>ELS</sub>
of each scattering angle can be written as</p>

intensity calculated for the diameter which corresponds to the length of the
short axis.<i> I</i><sub>NE</sub> is the signal intensity calculated for the

<p class="body">

</figure>


<p class="body">
  The calculation result for
&#951;=0.65 is shown in Figure 5 (b). The dashed line of Figure 5 (b) is
modified values of calculation results of 50 nm. As a result, the relative
signal intensity is similar to that of experimental result. </p>

<p class="body">
 Next, the experimental result of
electrode geometry of Figure 1c is analyzed by the same way. The length of the
long axis is estimated to 400 nm ~ 500 nm from
SEM image. As the results of theoretical calculations for the diameter from 400
nm to 500 nm, the signal profile was considerably similar to that of
experimental result of Figure 3(b) in the case of application of the electric
field when the diameters were set to 470 nm. The same value of alignment ratio
(&#951;=0.65) is also used for calculation. In the case of no electric field,
the same value as Figure 3 (a) case (160 nm) is used. Again, the results for
diameters of 470 nm and 160 nm are an average of the result for 450–490 nm and
155–165 nm, respectively. </p>

<p class="body">
  
All experimental results under
four different conditions are shown together in Figure 6. The results of
theoretical calculation for three parameters are shown in Figure 7. When we use
alignment ratio &#951;=0.65, theoretical calculation results of both short and
long axes behave in nearly the same way to the experimental results.</p>

<p class="body">
  
The reason why the observed
length of the free rotation particle is 160 nm can be considered as follows.
The direction of polarization of the incident beam is fixed. As the scattering
light intensity depends on the projective component with respect to the
direction of polarization of the incident beam, the projective component is
determined by the average of the sine component of the length of the long axis.
The average of sine component can be written as</p>

<p class="body">
  We have to consider rotation in the perpendicular plane and
the parallel plane against the propagation direction of the incident beam
because of 3-dimensional rotation. In considering the projection to both
planes, the effective length of the rotating particle is considered to be <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;;position:relative;
'><img width=83 height=32 src="IJTAN%20-%20003_files/image019.png"></span> 
times the length of the long axis. Because the length of the long axis is 470
nm, the free rotation length should be 470 nm × 0.405 ~190 nm. The experimental
value of 160 nm is nearly the same as calculation value. </p>

<p class="body">
  
The experimental result and
theoretical calculation show qualitatively same behavior. It can be said that
the needle-like TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are aligned because of rotation
and migration due to the electric field.</p>

<p class="body">
  
The mechanism of alignment is not
yet clear. The electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis are considered as the
cause of migration of nanoparticles.</p>

<p class="body">
  
The electrophoresis is caused by
the Zeta potential of nanoparticle. It is reported that the Zeta potential of
the TiO<sub>2</sub> particle is small in neutral solutions [6]. Water is used
as the solution in this experiment. Therefore, it is hard to consider that the
electrophoresis due to Zeta potential of TiO<sub>2</sub> is caused in pure
water.</p>

<p class="body">
  
Dielectrophoresis is produced by
the difference of permittivity between the particle and the ambient medium and
by the gradient of the electric field [7]. Since, there is no gradient of the
electric field because of the shape of the electrode in this experiment, it is
considered that the dielectrophoretic force must be small.</p>

<p class="body">
  
Most probable explanations of
alignment may be considered as follows. The dielectric polarization is induced
in the particle by the electric field. The non-spherical nanoparticle rotates
by the torque due to electric field at the position of center between
electrodes. At the position of slightly stir from the center, nanoparticle is
rotated and pulled by the Coulomb force from the electrode.</p>

<h4> 4. Conclusion </h4>


<p class="body">
  Comparing the experimental data
and the theoretical calculations, we conclude that the TiO<sub>2</sub>
needle-like nanoparticles are aligned because of the rotation and the migration
in solution under the electric field. The behavior of the light scattering
signal shows the alignment of the needle-like nanoparticles. However, the
signal intensity is slightly different from the theoretical calculation.
Therefore, we have to increase the precision of the measurement for the
accurate estimation of the size of non-spherical nanoparticles by improving the
measurement system.</p>
