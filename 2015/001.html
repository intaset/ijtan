    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>By the use of the thermal decomposition of rare earth (RE) amides to nitrides, the preparation of nanostructural RE nitrides (CeN, PrN, NdN, SmN, GdN, TbN, DyN, HoN and ErN) was extensively studied in search of optimal conditions. In this method, the preparation of amides as an effective precursor for the nitrides was similarly of importance; the amide was here prepared by high-pressure reactions of RE hydrides with ammonia in an autoclave or reactive ball milling of the RE hydrides and ammonia. CeN, PrN, NdN and SmN were successfully prepared by the thermal decomposition of the RE amides or amide-like compounds formed by the reaction of the dihydrides with ammonia, whereas GdN, TbN, DyN, HoN and ErN were not obtained in this way. The dihydrides of gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium and erbium were generally too stable to react with ammonia to form the amides compared to those of cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and samarium. In the preparation of CeN, PrN and SmN, the amide precursors obtained by the autoclave reaction of the dihydrides with ammonia yielded nanostructural nitrides with higher surface areas (3.9-5.9 m<sup>2</sup>/g), compared to those obtained by the reactive ball milling method.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">There has been a growing
interest in science and application of rare earth (RE) materials [1-3]. We
have studied catalytic properties of a variety of RE compounds [4-8]. It has
been recently found that RE nitrides are very active as a catalyst; thus
europium and ytterbium nitride (EuN and YbN) obtained by the thermal
decomposition of their amides show catalytic activity for the partial
hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene [9,10] and the selective dimerization
of olefin [11]. Europium amide (Eu(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and ytterbium
amide (Yb(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Yb(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>)
prepared by taking advantage of the solubility of Eu and Yb metals in liquid
ammonia are effective precursors for the formation of EuN and YbN,
respectively. The thermal decomposition of the europium and ytterbium amides
thus obtained leads to active nanocrystalline EuN and YbN with high surface
areas of 49-107 and 123-146 m<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively [10, 12, 13]. Thus
the use of solubility of Eu and Yb in liquid ammonia provides a useful method
for obtaining the active nanostructural nitrides.</p>

<p class="body">Other RE metals than Eu
and Yb exhibit poor solubility toward liquid ammonia, and hence similar
procedures cannot be applied to the preparation of nitrides. There have been
studies reported on many processes for the preparation of nitrides [14, 15],
but none is fully satisfactory for catalysts. The direct reaction of RE metals
with ammonia or nitrogen at elevated temperatures is undesirable for the
preparation of stoichiometric nitrides [16].</p>

<p class="body">Our investigation has been
directed to the preparation of nanostructural RE nitrides with high surface
areas. In view of the fact that the pyrolysis of the amide Eu and Yb amide was
effective for the formation of nanostructural nitrides, in this study we
undertook to use amides as a precursor of nitrides to synthesize nanostructural
CeN, PrN, NdN, SmN, GdN, TbN, DyN, HoN and ErN.</p>

<p class="body">RE hydride + NH<sub>3</sub>
&#8594; RE amide &#8722;<i> (pyrolysis)</i> &#8594; nanostructural RE nitride</p>

<p class="body">Therefore, by the use of
the reaction of metal hydrides with ammonia to prepare amides as a precursor
[17, 18], interest has centred on the preparation conditions and the influence
of differences in preparation methods on the properties of the nitrides
formed. This research has been reported in preliminary form [19]. The
preparation of RE amides is here investigated by two methods; one was reactive
ball milling under an ammonia atmosphere and the other was high-pressure
reactions in an autoclave at 473-573 K.</p>

<h4>2. Experimental</h4>

<p class="subhead">2.1. Materials</p>

<p class="body">RE metals (99.9%; Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho
and Er) were purchased from the Santoku Co. and used in powder form by filing.
Ammonia gas (Iwatani Ind. Ltd.) was purified through a calcium oxide column and
subsequently through a sodium hydroxide column. </p>

<p class="subhead">2.2. Procedures of sample
preparation</p>

<p class="body">To prepare the RE hydrides, the reaction of the RE
metals with hydrogen was carried out with a glass apparatus provided with a
high vacuum system (ca. 2.7 x 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa). Prior to the reaction, Ce,
Pr, Nd or Sm powders were subjected to evacuation at 473 K for 2 h, then the
hydrogenation of the metals was carried out at room temperature by introducing
hydrogen gas of 0.066 MPa into a reactor with a fixed volume. Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho
or Er powders were similarly evacuated at 623 K for 2 h, followed by the
hydrogenation at 473 K. In all the metals used the amounts of absorbed
hydrogen were determined by changes in pressures to become RE dihydrides.</p>

<p class="body">The reaction of the dihydrides with ammonia was
subsequently carried out with two methods. One was reactive ball milling
(Fritsch Ltd.: P-6) under an ammonia atmosphere and the other was high-pressure
reactions (12-14 MPa) in an autoclave at 473-573 K for 48 h. In a typical preparation
of cerium amide by ball milling [19], cerium dihydride (0.25 g) was placed in a
grinding bowl (made of zirconia; volume of 45 cm<sup>3</sup>), followed by
introduction of 0.3 MPa ammonia. The mixtures were subjected to ball milling
with zirconia balls (diameter: 3 mm, 55 g) for 0.25-20 h, operated at 650 rpm.
Ball milling of other dihydrides and ammonia was similarly carried out to yield
the RE amides.</p>

<p class="body">To obtain the RE nitrides, the amides thus
prepared decomposed under evacuation in the temperature range 300-1073 K.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.3. Characterization </p>

<p class="body">X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the samples
obtained were conducted with a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (RINT 2200) using
Cu-K<sub>&#945;</sub> radiation. Thermal desorption spectrum (TDS)
measurements were made in vacuo at a heating rate of 3 Kmin<sup>-1</sup> by
continuously monitoring desorbed gases via quadrupolar mass spectrometer (Canon
ANELVA Co.: M-101QA-TDF). Surface areas were measured with a Shimadzu TriStar
3000. All procedures of the RE samples obtained here were carried out without
exposure to air.</p>

<h4>3. Results and Discussion</h4>

<p class="subhead">3.1. Preparation of RE
amides or amide-like compounds by the reactions of RE dihydrides with ammonia</p>

<p class="body">First the preparation of
RE hydrides by the direct reaction of the RE metals with hydrogen gas was
carried out with measuring the amounts of absorbed hydrogen [20]. The RE metals
used reacted normally with hydrogen to form the dihydrides. Upon increasing
the hydrogen pressures, the dihydrides additionally absorbed hydrogen until a
composition near trihydrides was reached. The RE hydrides with the
composition of CeH<sub>2.01</sub>, PrH<sub>2.01</sub>, NdH<sub>2.04</sub>, SmH<sub>2.02</sub>,
GdH<sub>1.94</sub>, TbH<sub>1.99</sub>, DyH<sub>2.00</sub>, HoH<sub>1.71</sub>
and ErH<sub>1.84</sub> were successfully prepared for use in this study, and
the formation of all the dihydrides with a fluorite type structure was
confirmed by XRD [20, 21].</p>

<p class="subhead">3.1.1. Reactive ball
milling of RE dihydrides and ammonia</p>

<p class="body">The RE dihydrides thus
prepared were subsequently subjected to reactive ball milling under an
atmosphere of NH<sub>3</sub> for the reaction of the hydrides with ammonia; the
hydride samples were placed in a grinding bowl made of zirconia, followed by
introduction of ammonia gas at a pressure of 0.3 MPa. The mixtures were subjected
to high-energy ball milling for 0.25-20 h. The dihydrides of cerium,
praseodymium, neodymium and samarium readily reacted with ammonia upon ball
milling. According to time courses of changes in XRD, the diffraction peaks
corresponding to the dihydrides were considerably broadened and gradually
diminished with milling times, due to a rapid progress of the
nanocrystallization and the following reactions with ammonia. The results on
the cerium dihydride were shown in Figs. 1a-c as a typical example [19]. The
cerium dihydride immediately reacted with ammonia upon ball milling, and the
cerium samples during ball milling varied from initially black to mint green at
the end. After ball milling for 7 h, the XRD peaks of the dihydrides were
hardly observed. However, there were no additional diffraction peaks which
suggested new phases or products resulting from reactions of the cerium
dihydride with ammonia; thus, no diffraction peaks assigned to the amide were
observed. Although cerium amide was most likely formed upon reactions of the
cerium dihydride with ammonia, regrettably, the formation of the cerium amide
was not confirmed by XRD, probably due to a nanostructured or amorphous state.
In reactive ball milling of the hydrides and ammonia, the dihydrides of
praseodymium, neodymium and samarium showed behavior similar to the cerium
dihydride as shown in Table 1, whereas the dihydrides of gadolinium, terbium,
dysprosium, holmium and erbium hardly reacted with ammonia under the same
milling conditions. The hydride phase of gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,
holmium and erbium remained unchanged during ball milling as shown in XRD
results for dysprosium (Fig. 2) as an example. This is probably due to that
the dihydrides of gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium and erbium are
thermodynamically too stable to react with ammonia to form the amides compared
to those of cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and samarium. The differences in
the reactivity of RE hydrides thus observed are almost consistent with the order
of hydride stability evaluated by the free energy of formation of the RE
dihydride [20].</p>

<p class="body">The samples obtained after
ball milling of the dihydrides of cerium, praseodymium, neodymium or
samarium with ammonia were found to be converted into the nitride when
subjected to thermal treatment at around 873 K as described in the next
section. This indicates that the reaction products by ball milling of RE
dihydride (RE: Ce, Pr, Nd or Sm)/NH<sub>3</sub> are certainly RE amides or
amide-like compounds, which thermally decompose to the nitrides as described
later in XRD and TDS results. Upon ball milling of the dihydrides of cerium,
praseodymium, neodymium or samarium under an atmosphere of NH<sub>3</sub>, thus
these hydrides readily reacted with ammonia, resulting in the formation of the
RE amides as shown in eq. (1).</p>

<p class="subhead">3.1.2. High-pressure
reactions of RE dihydrides with ammonia in an autoclave</p>

<p class="body">For the dihydrides of cerium, praseodymium and
samarium which showed higher reactivity than those of gadolinium, terbium,
dysprosium, holmium and erbium, the high-pressure reaction of the RE dihydrides
with ammonia in an autoclave at elevated temperatures was further undertaken.
In a 50 cm<sup>3</sup> autoclave were placed the RE dihydrides under an
atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The reactor was briefly evacuated, cooled by a dry
ice/methanol bath, and then, about 4.4 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m<sup>3</sup> of
purified ammonia gas was liquefied. The reaction mixtures were subsequently
stirred and the autoclave reaction was carried out under 12-14 MPa at 473-573 K
for 48 h. Since the rise of reaction temperature induced the instability of RE
hydride, resulting in acceleration of the reaction of hydride with ammonia, the
reaction temperature of 573 K was more efficient than that of 473 K. The
reaction products of cerium dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub> at 573 K for 48h were
obtained as dark brown fine powders and the XRD results were shown in Fig. 1d,
in comparison with the results on the products obtained by ball milling. There
were no diffraction peaks arising from products or new phases in XRD, being similar
to the results for the ball milling method as shown in Figs. 1b and c. XRD of
the reaction products for praseodymium and samarium were similar to that for
cerium.</p>

<p class="subhead">3.2. Thermal decomposition
of reaction products of RE dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub> to nitrides</p>

<p class="body">To obtain the RE nitrides,
the reaction products of RE dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub> thus obtained thermally
decomposed under evacuation in the temperature range 300-1073 K. The thermal
decomposition processes were followed by taking XRD measurements as a function
of evacuation temperatures. As shown by changes in XRD (Figs. 3a-d) for the
milling products of cerium dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub> for 7 h, the decomposition
started from about 673 K and the diffraction peaks of cerium nitride CeN with
cubic structure were clearly observed upon thermal treatment at about 873 K.
This strongly indicates that the reaction of CeH<sub>2.01</sub> with NH<sub>3</sub>
certainly occurs to form amides or amide-like products as a precursor for CeN
[19]. It was found that upon treatment at higher temperatures the considerable
crystallization of CeN proceeded further. On the other hand, the reaction
products of cerium dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub> in an autoclave showed the similar decomposition
behavior (Figs. 4a-d), but broad diffraction peaks of CeN were only just
observed upon evacuation at around 1073 K. Nanostructured CeN appears to
develop from the reaction products by the autoclave method rather than the
milling method. This reflects differences in surface areas and crystallite
sizes (Table 2); thus, CeN prepared by the autoclave reaction showed surface
areas about an order of magnitude larger than CeN by the milling method.</p>

<p class="body">When heated above 873 K, the reaction
products of RE dihydride (RE: Pr, Nd or Sm)/NH<sub>3</sub> decomposed to PrN, NdN
or SmN, as well as the case of cerium dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub>, respectively
(Tables 1 and 2). This similarly leads to speculation of amides or amide-like
products in the reaction of the hydrides of praseodymium, neodymium or samarium
with ammonia. For gadolinium, terbium dysprosium, holmium and erbium, however,
their hydrides exhibited negligible reactivity toward ammonia in reactive ball
milling as described above, and naturally, the formation of the nitrides by the
thermal decomposition was not confirmed at all. The results obtained were
summarized in Table 1.</p>

<p class="subhead">3.3. Decomposition
processes to nitrides by TDS</p>

<p class="body">To evaluate the processes
of the thermal decomposition to CeN, TDS for the products of cerium
dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub> milled for 7 h was studied. As shown in Fig. 5, the
TDS traces showed a desorption peak of NH<sub>3</sub> at 350-500 K, broad
desorption peaks of H<sub>2</sub> at temperatures of around 430 and 500 K, and
small desorption of N<sub>2</sub> at 700-950 K [19]. Taking into account
the conversion processes of ytterbium and europium amides (Yb(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
and Eu(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) to the nitrides (YbN and EuN) [10,12],
respectively, the changes of the cerium amide to the nitride are considered as
follows. The cerium amide (Ce(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) probably decomposed
to form cerium imide (CeNH) with the evolution of NH<sub>3</sub> at about 400 K
according to eq. (2). Subsequently, the conversion (eq. 3) into the CeN
nitride accompanying the evolution of H<sub>2</sub> occurred ranging in
temperature from 430 to 700 K as shown in Fig. 5.</p>

<p class="body">Amides are usually
considered to be converted into nitrides through imides [22-24]; thus the
thermal decomposition of Ce(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> to CeN successively
occurs here. However, the formation of CeNH was not confirmed in XRD (Fig.
3). In the decomposition reactions of RE amides, the formation of imide
intermediates hasn't been recognized very often. Juza et al. [22] report that
there is no evidence of imide formation in the conversion process of Eu(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
into EuN. However, the TDS results obtained here were almost consistent with
the conversion of the cerium amide into the nitride expressed by eqs. (2) and
(3). The evolution of N<sub>2</sub> observed at 700-950 K is probably due to
further decomposition of CeN to CeN<sub>1-x</sub>.</p>

<p class="body">The
TDS traces of the milling products of RE dihydride (RE: Pr, Nd or Sm)/NH<sub>3</sub>
were similar to those of cerium dihydride/NH<sub>3</sub>, leading to
speculations of consecutive reactions via imide intermediates in the
decomposition processes to the nitrides. It is shown by LaValle [18] that the
RE nitrides are directly formed when the reaction of hydrides with ammonia is
carried out at higher temperatures 1073-1173 K. </p>

<p class="body">TDS
of the products obtained by the autoclave reaction of cerium dihydride with
ammonia was also measured and the TDS traces obtained were similar to those for
the milling products. In conclusion, the decomposition reactions of both
products proceeded in a similar manner to yield the CeN nitride. For the autoclave
reaction products the desorption of H<sub>2</sub> was similarly observed from
500 to 700 K, while the desorption of N<sub>2</sub> occurred in somewhat higher
temperature range of about 750 to 1000 K. This is consistent with the
variations of XRD with thermal treatment as shown in Fig. 4, implying that CeN
obtained by the autoclave method exhibits higher heat-stability. CeN obtained
by the milling method was chocolate and 0.22 m<sup>2</sup>/g, while CeN by the
autoclave method was black and 3.9 m<sup>2</sup>/g (Table 2). XRD studies
yielded crystallite size estimates for the CeN samples of the milling method
and the autoclave method as 5.1 and 2.0 nm, respectively. Moreover, for praseodymium
and samarium, the influence of differences between the two preparation methods
on the surface areas of the resulting nitrides was also observed as shown in
Table 2. For the RE nitrides examined, the surface areas of the samples
obtained by the autoclave method were on the whole larger by over an order of
magnitude than those by the milling method. In view of that a marked
difference in the decomposition processes to RE nitrides between the reaction
products obtained by the two methods was not observed, the drop in surface
areas by the ball milling method likely leads to growing over fracturing of
nitride particles formed during the milling process.</p>

<h4>4. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">The
preparation of nanostructural RE nitrides by the use of the reactions of RE
hydrides with ammonia has been studied extensively. CeN, PrN, NdN and SmN were
successfully prepared by the thermal decomposition of amides obtained by the
reaction of RE dihydride (RE: Ce, Pr, Nd or Sm) with ammonia, whereas GdN, TbN,
DyN, HoN and ErN were not obtained in a similar manner due to high stability of
the hydrides. The reaction of the RE dihydrides with ammonia was investigated
by the two methods: reactive ball milling and autoclave reactions at high
pressure. The autoclave reaction method yielded nanostructural nitrides with
high surface areas, compared to the ball milling method. XRD and TDS studies
strongly suggested that in the decomposition processes of amides to nitrides,
the cerium amide decomposed to imide with evolution of ammonia at around 400 K,
followed by conversion into the CeN nitride from about 450 K with evolution of
hydrogen.</p>
