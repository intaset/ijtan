<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The transport properties of semiconductor multiple quantum well (MQW) heterostructures was first studied by Esaki and Tsu (1970). Not long after, Kazarinov

and Suris suggested using the superlattice

heterostructures for the amplification of

electromagnetic waves via intersubband transitions (Kazarinov and Suris, 1971). Intersubband transitions in the conduction band would allow

for the absorption and emission of infrared photons, which is not feasible in

the interband scheme.

However, the intersubband light amplification

requires resonant tunneling in order to operate in the electrically stable

positive differential resistance regime. Resonant tunneling occurs when two

energy states from two separate quantum wells anticross

across a barrier at a given electric field. Moreover, resonant tunneling can be

characterized by either a coherent or sequential transport mechanism. In the

former case, the large anticrossing between the

coupled states results in a Fabry-Perot like carrier

transport. However, in the latter case that is also known as sequential

tunneling, significant electron scattering within the well makes each quantum

tunneling independent of each other (Aleshkin et al.,

2006). For the case of sequential tunneling (with coupling strength of &#937; and dephasing

time of &#964;<sub>//</sub>) and electron scattering (with rate of &#964;<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup>),

it was found that the transport becomes coherent if 4&#8486;<sup>2</sup>&#964;<sub>2</sub>

&#964;<sub>||</sub> &gt;&gt; 1 and is incoherent if 4&#8486;<sup>2</sup>&#964;<sub>2</sub>

&#964;<sub>||</sub> &lt;&lt; 1 (Kazarinov and Suris, 1971).</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">MQWs in conjunction with intersubband

transitions have led to the development of quantum cascade lasers (QCL) with

emission spectra in the mid- and far-infrared (Williams, 2007). The first QCL,

lasing at 4.2 &mu;m, was demonstrated by Faist et al.

(1994) at Bell Labs. Numerous applications involving QCL have emerged since the

Bell Labs development such as high-resolution spectroscopy, terahertz imaging

for non-invasive inspection, and plasma diagnostics (Williams, 2007; Hu, 2008).

Moreover, MQW heterostructures can be utilized as

functional devices such as multiple-valued memory cells (Seabaugh

et al., 1992) by taking advantage of its negative differential resistance

(NDR), the signature property of resonant tunnelling (Capasso

and Kiehl, 1985). NDR is a property that manifests

itself in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics where the rate of change

goes from positive to negative as the voltage across the device increases. This

is explained through the breaking and creation of resonance between the finite

states inside the quantum wells and the conduction band in the emitter side as

a bias is applied (Sun, 1998). Beyond intersubband

transitions and infrared emission and absorption, MQW heterostructure

devices have also been designed for blue light emitting diodes (Yang et al.,

2000).</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">During the last two decades, many groups have reported MQW structures

used for intersubband emission and absorption of

infrared light from III-V and II-VI materials such as GaAs/AlGaAs, InAs/AlSb,

and ZnO/MgZnO (Helm et al.,

1988; Warburton et al., 1995; Ohtani et al., 2009).

More recently, GaN and its nitride alloys have

attracted a lot of attention due to its high conduction band offset with AlN (1.7 eV) (Rigutti

et al., 2010), allowing for deep confinement of states within the quantum

wells, short relaxation times of less than 150 fs (Iizuka et al., 2000; Hamazaki et

al., 2004), allowing for the development of high frequency oscillators and

ultrafast optical switches, and large longitudinal optical (LO) phonon energy

of 92 meV, allowing for photon emission in the

wavelength regions that was not accessible previously (e.g. between 30 and 70&#956;m and

below 2.5 &#956;m, as

small as 1.08 &mu;m) (Kishino et al., 2002). The GaN/AlN system can thus be

designed for the fiber-optics transmission wavelength range of 1.3 to 1.55 &mu;m (Kandaswamy, 2008). </p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Unfortunately, GaN-based resonant tunneling

diodes still remains a challenge in terms of producing repeatable NDR with a

large peak-to-valley ratio, both at cryogenic and room temperature (RT)

conditions (Bayram et al., 2010). In c-plane

nitride-based RTDs, the I-V characteristics tend to degrade irreversibly after

the initial voltage scan. Repeatable NDR, however, has been observed in wurtzite nitrides on nonpolar (m-plane) GaN

substrates (Li et al., 2012). It has been shown that a non-polar orientation

should improve resonant tunneling when compared to a polar one, and that AlN barriers, compared to AlGaN

ones, will result in higher peak-to-valley ratios (Carnevale

et al., 2012). This absence of reproducibility has been largely attributed to

the charge trapping at dislocation sites (Golka et al.,

2006). Furthermore, leakage paths through dislocations may lead to relatively

small peak-to-valley ratios (1.03, Li et al.), pushing the need for dislocation

free nitride structures.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">III-nitrides are very interesting due to their high breakdown voltage

(for GaN, 3 MV/cm), high electron mobility (for GaN, 1000-2000 cm<sup>2 </sup>V<sup>-1 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>)

and high heat capacity and thermal conductivity (for GaN,

&gt;1.5 Wcm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>)

(Eastman and Mishra, 2002). Unfortunately, the growth of high quality GaN/AlN heterostructures

is limited due to the existing lattice mismatch (~ 2.5%) and the lack of

suitable large area substrates. In this work, by virtue of strain relaxation in

nanowires, we have grown high quality GaN/AlN 1D heterostructures with very

low threading dislocation density (Wang et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2011; Fathololoumi et al., 2011; Rigutti

et al., 2010). The free lateral surfaces of the nanowire allow for strain

relaxation, preventing dislocations from appearing within the nanowire

structure (Glas, 2006). Here, we report the negative

differential resistance in GaN/AlN

multiple quantum well heterostructure nanowires.</p>


<h2>2. Fabrication and Results</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The GaN/AlN heterostructure nanowires with 10 AlN

barriers were grown on Si (111) substrates using self-catalytic growth process,

by radio-frequency plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy.

The growth process was performed under nitrogen rich conditions, favouring the

formation of the nanowire structure as opposed to a planar one. Furthermore, a

self-catalytic growth process involving Ga droplets

on the surface of the silicon substrate is preferred to avoid any unwanted

contamination with metal catalysts that are typically used in other III-V

nanowire growth procedures (Calarco et al., 2007).

The nanowires are oriented along the [0001] polar direction with their

sidewalls being non-polar m-planes. The diagram of the nanowire structure can

be seen in Fig. 1-a. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy, shown in

Fig. 2-a, depicts dense hexagonal nanowires, uniformly distributed across the

wafer. A closer look at the transmission electron micrograph of the nanowires

reveals that the structures are grown nearly free of dislocations (see Figs.

2-b-c). Moreover, micro-photoluminescence measurements were performed (shown in

Fig. 3) with a HeCd laser (&#955; ~ 325 nm), a

high-resolution spectrometer and a photomultiplier tube. A strong peak is

observed at 3.42 eV with a narrow FWHM of 0.1 eV, indicating nanowires of high quality. In addition,

there is no sign of yellow luminescence at ~2.2 eV at

RT in the &mu;-PL measurements. Yellow luminescence in GaN

is said to arise from transitions between the conduction band (or shallow donors) and deep acceptor levels (Shalish et al., 1999). This phenomenon can severely degrade

the performance of optoelectronic devices by creating a secondary recombination

path (Kucheyev et al., 2002). The nanowires have a

height of ~850 nm and a diameter of ~45 nm near the GaN/AlN periodic structure. Tapering and consequently

coalescence of the GaN/AlN

nanowires also appear to occur, as shown in Figs. 2-a-b. In our case, tapering

is partly caused by the introduction of the AlN

disks. The slower migration rate of Al atoms versus Ga

atoms leads to a slower vertical growth rate of AlN

compared to GaN and ultimately wider diameters at the

AlN disks. Coalescence of the nanowires can lead to

unwanted electrical behaviour with current bypassing the periodic tunnelling

structure and effectively shorting the device. Tapering of the nanowires can

possibly be controlled by a Ga-flux during the growth

process (Meijers et al., 2006).</p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Fig. 2-c shows that ~2.5 nm thick GaN disks

are separated using ten ~2.5 nm thick AlN disks,

forming a multiple barrier tunneling structure. The entire AlN/GaN disks are sandwiched between two highly Si-doped (carrier

concentration of ~1E19 cm<sup>-3</sup>) GaN cladding

regions (length of ~ 400 nm) used to facilitate the single nanowire contact

process. Three samples, denoted samples A, B, and C, with Si-doping level of ~

0, 2E16 cm<sup>-3</sup>, and 1E17 cm<sup>-3</sup>,

respectively, are utilized to study the effect of doping on the

tunneling through AlN barriers. Here, we have focused

on single nanowire devices to test I-V characteristics of the GaN/AlN multiple barrier tunnel junction.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The single nanowire devices were fabricated by dispersing nanowires

horizontally onto a SiO<sub>2</sub> template and by drawing the contacts using

electron beam lithography to deposit metal contacts of Ti/Al/Ti/Au (10/50/10/50

nm). The single nanowire devices, shown in Figs. 4 and 5, were fabricated using

the three different Si-doped samples. I-V measurements were performed in a

cryogenic test chamber at RT and at 78 K, under high vacuum (~1E-7 torr) and dark conditions. A 2400 Keithley

was used to measure the I-V characteristics.</p>

<br>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Single nanowire devices were tested with successive voltage sweeps

(typically increasing in amplitude, up to 12 V). NDR was clearly observed in

the nanowire, as seen in Fig. 6. However, the shape and position of the NDR

peaks vary significantly between each voltage measurement. The device stability

also degrades with the NDR disappearing after multiple sweeps, suggesting that

dislocations and charge trapping are still present in the nanowire structure. Nonetheless,

NDR was present initially in both the RT and 78 K measurements with a peak-to-valley

ratio of ~1.4.</p>



<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Temperature dependence tests were also performed at 78, 100, 150, 200,

250 and 300 K. In general, a clearer NDR effect was observed at lower

temperatures. In devices that displayed little NDR at RT but prominent NDR at

low temperatures, lower resistivity at lower temperatures was also observed.

Similar results were achieved for AlGaAs/GaAs superlattice structures as

previously shown (Capasso et al., 1985). However, Rigutti observed the opposite in which decreasing the

temperature leads to higher resistivity and more prominent NDR in GaN/AlN superlattice

nanowires (Rigutti et al., 2010). In our case, there

is the possibility of a "hard breaking" in the device, in which a permanent

physical change has occurred due to electrical stress. Hysteresis was also

observed in the nanowires displaying NDR when the voltage was swept back

towards zero, and can be attributed to the bias-dependent trapping of electrons

in the quantum wells (Belyaev et al., 2003).</p>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Ensemble

nanowire samples were also tested. In general, no noticeable NDR was present in

the RT experiments, due to non-uniformity of the nanowires over the large area.

However, the NDR was found when testing ensemble nanowire devices at 78 K. The

ensemble nanowire samples achieved a peak-to-valley ratio of ~1.2. Moreover, it

was found that doping the nanowires with Si improved slightly the occurrence of

NDR in the I-V characteristics for both the single nanowire and ensemble

nanowire devices.</p>



<h2>3. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In conclusion, GaN/AlN

multiple quantum well nanowires have been grown by radio-frequency assisted

molecular beam epitaxy. Although negative

differential resistance was only observed at 78 K for the ensemble nanowire

samples, it was found to be present at 78 K as well as room temperature for the

single nanowire devices, an important step forward in achieving room temperature

infrared emission and absorption via intersubband

transitions. A peak-to-valley ratio of ~1.4 was found; however, repeatability

of the I-V measurements still remains an issue. Moreover, the effects of Si

doping did appear to improve slightly the negative differential resistance.

Future works will involve more in depth characterization of doping and

annealing effects on the electrical performance of the nanowires. Variations in

the well and barrier widths will be optimized to achieve higher transmission

coefficients (shorter tunneling time).</p>
